This repository is an accompaniment to the ExoSpec manuscript published in _to be confirmed_, titled 
_"Detecting clinically significant prostate cancer with urine: a multivariable risk model integrating urinary proteomic and cell-free RNA data"_. 
The repository forms the anlayses and results of the manuscript. Within you'll find the RMarkdown files that can be knitted to produce the Methods and Results sections verbatim. 

Great care has been taken throughout this work to ensure reproducibility. As such, all code required to **quantitatively** reproduce the analyses presented can be found here, including the RMarkdown file to produce the final formatted manuscript as submitted for peer review. For those lacking computational resources or the suitable rights over their environment this project has been set up with a Binder instance and RStudio Server.
