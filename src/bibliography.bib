abstract = {BACKGROUND The newly proposed five-tiered prostate cancer grading system (PCGS) divides Gleason score (GS) 8–10 disease into GS 8 and GS 9–10 on the basis of biochemical recurrence (BCR) following radical prostatectomy (RP) as an outcome. However, BCR does not necessarily portend worse survival outcomes. OBJECTIVE To assess the significance of distinguishing GS 8 versus 9–10 disease in terms of long-term survival outcomes for both the preoperative setting using biopsy (Bx) GS and the postoperative setting with RP GS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Of 23918 men who underwent RP between 1984 and 2014, there were 721 men with biopsy GS 8–10, and 1047 men with RP GS 8–10. OUTCOME MEASURES AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Clinicopathologic characteristics were compared between men with GS 8 and those with GS 9–10. We compared all-cause mortality (ACM) and prostate cancer–specific mortality (PCSM) risk between the groups using Cox regression and competing-risks analyses, adjusting for other perioperative variables and death from other causes as the competing event. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Compared to men with GS 8, men with GS 9–10 had later RP year and higher pathologic stage. Among men with Bx GS 8–10, 115 died (82 due to PC) with median follow-up of 3 yr (interquartile range [IQR] 1–7) for both overall and cancer-specific survival. Of men with RP GS 8–10, 221 died (151 due to PC) with median follow-up of 4 yr (IQR 2–8) and 4 yr (IQR 2–9) for overall and cancer-specific survival, respectively. PC-specific survival rates were significantly lower for men with GS 9–10 compared to men with GS 8 for both Bx (hazard ratio [HR] 2.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.37–3.30; p<0.01) and RP GS (HR 2.38, 95% CI 1.74–3.28; p<0.01). This association persisted in multivariable models after adjusting for perioperative variables. CONCLUSIONS Men with GS 9–10 had higher ACM and PCSM rates compared to those with GS 8. GS 8 and GS 9–10 PC should be considered separately in both the preoperative and postoperative setting as suggested by the new PCGS. PATIENT SUMMARY The prostate cancer grading system can predict mortality risk after radical prostatectomy (RP) for men with Gleason score 8–10 disease based on both biopsy and RP Gleason scores. There are significant differences in all-cause mortality and prostate cancer–specific mortality following surgery between men with Gleason score 8 and those with Gleason score 9–10 disease.},

abstract = {Only a very small fraction of the many tumor biomarkers discovered are successfully translated from the academic research laboratory into clinical practice. The pathway has not always been linear and has involved people with expertise in a wide range of specialties, including basic research, assay development, clinical affairs, regulatory affairs, marketing, business, oncology, and executive-management leadership. The experience with a tumor biomarker, the PCA3 [prostate cancer gene 3 (non-protein coding)] gene, illustrates the long and winding road that must be navigated. Here we reflect, from a historical point of view, on how the interface between academic science, industry, urologists, and clinical laboratories has been essential to advance biomarkers from solid basic science to a validated clinical laboratory test. PCA3 was first described as DD3 in 1999 by Bussemakers and colleagues (1). Researchers in the Isaacs laboratory at Johns Hopkins University used differential-display analysis to compare patterns of mRNA production in benign and malignant prostate tissue, with the goal of identifying unknown genes involved in prostate tumorigenesis. PCA3 expression was further characterized in the Schalken laboratory at Radboud University, Nijmegen (2), and this research confirmed 2 important properties of PCA3 as a prostate cancer (PCa)6 marker: PCA3 expression is prostate tissue specific, and PCA3 is highly overexpressed in PCa compared with benign tissue. This PCa-specific overexpression led the Nijmegen researchers to assess the feasibility of a PCA3 -based urine test for PCa detection. In 2001, a license for PCA3 was obtained by DiagnoCure, a company in Qu{\'{e}}bec City, Canada, to develop the assay and provide a clinical application. Transfer of a cancer biomarker to industry requires both the appropriate technology and a proper cancer strategy. The Nijmegen methodology was converted from PCR to nucleic acid sequence–based amplification (NASBA), a {\ldots}},

abstract = {Purpose: An update is provided of the Gleason grading system, which has evolved significantly since its initial description. Materials and Methods: A search was performed using the MEDLINE?? database and referenced lists of relevant studies to obtain articles concerning changes to the Gleason grading system. Results: Since the introduction of the Gleason grading system more than 40 years ago many aspects of prostate cancer have changed, including prostate specific antigen testing, transrectal ultrasound guided prostate needle biopsy with greater sampling, immunohistochemistry for basal cells that changed the classification of prostate cancer and new prostate cancer variants. The system was updated at a 2005 consensus conference of international experts in urological pathology, under the auspices of the International Society of Urological Pathology. Gleason score 2-4 should rarely if ever be diagnosed on needle biopsy, certain patterns (ie poorly formed glands) originally considered Gleason pattern 3 are now considered Gleason pattern 4 and all cribriform cancer should be graded pattern 4. The grading of variants and subtypes of acinar adenocarcinoma of the prostate, including cancer with vacuoles, foamy gland carcinoma, ductal adenocarcinoma, pseudohyperplastic carcinoma and small cell carcinoma have also been modified. Other recent issues include reporting secondary patterns of lower and higher grades when present to a limited extent, and commenting on tertiary grade patterns which differ depending on whether the specimen is from needle biopsy or radical prostatectomy. Whereas there is little debate on the definition of tertiary pattern on needle biopsy, this issue is controversial in radical prostatectomy specimens. Although tertiary Gleason patterns are typically added to pathology reports, they are routinely omitted in practice since there is no simple way to incorporate them in predictive nomograms/tables, research studies and patient counseling. Thus, a modified radical prostatectomy Gleason scoring system was recently proposed to incorporate tertiary Gleason patterns in an intuitive fashion. For needle biopsy with different cores showing different grades, the current recommendation is to report the grades of each core separately, whereby the highest grade tumor is selected as the grade of the entire case to determine treatment, regardless of the percent involvement. After the 2005 consensus conference several studies confirmed the superiority of the modified Gleason system as well as its impact on urological practice. Conclusions: It is remarkable that nearly 40 years after its inception the Gleason grading system remains one of the most powerful prognostic factors for prostate cancer. This system has remained timely because of gradual adaptations by urological pathologists to accommodate the changing practice of medicine. ?? 2010 American Urological Association.},

@article{Balk2003,
abstract = {Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is an androgen-regulated serine protease produced by both prostate epithelial cells and prostate cancer (PCa) and is the most commonly used serum marker for cancer. It is a member of the tissue kallikrein family, some of the members of which are also prostate specific. PSA is a major protein in semen, where its function is to cleave semenogelins in the seminal coagulum. PSA is secreted into prostatic ducts as an inactive 244-amino acid proenzyme (proPSA) that is activated by cleavage of seven N-terminal amino acids. PSA that enters the circulation intact is rapidly bound by protease inhibitors, primarily alpha1-antichymotrypsin, although a fraction is inactivated in the lumen by proteolysis and circulates as free PSA. This proteolytic inactivation, as well as the cleavage of proPSA to PSA, is less efficient in PCa. Serum total PSA levels are increased in PCa, and PSA screening has dramatically altered PCa presentation and management. Unfortunately, although high PSA levels are predictive of advanced PCa, a large fraction of organ-confined cancers present with much lower total PSA values that overlap those levels found in men without PCa. Measurement of free versus total PSA can increase specificity for PCa, and tests under development to measure forms of proPSA may further enhance the ability to detect early-stage PCa. PSA is also widely used to monitor responses to therapy and is under investigation as a therapeutic target. Finally, recent data indicate that there may be additional roles for PSA in the pathogenesis of PCa.},

abstract = {Accurate prediction of survival of cancer patients is still a key open problem in clinical research. Recently, many large-scale gene expression clusterings have identified sets of genes reportedly predictive of prognosis; however, those gene sets shared few genes in common and were poorly validated using independent data. We have developed a systems biology-based approach by using either combined gene sets and the protein interaction network (Method A) or the protein network alone (Method B) to identify common prognostic genes based on microarray gene expression data of glioblastoma multiforme and compared with differential gene expression clustering (Method C). Validations of prediction performance show that the 23-prognostic gene classifier identified by Method A outperforms other gene classifiers identified by Methods B and C or previously reported for gliomas on 17 of 20 independent sample cohorts across five tumor types. We also find that among the 23 genes are 21 related to cellular proliferation and two related to response to stress/immune response. We further find that the increased expression of the 21 genes and the decreased expression of the other two genes are associated with poorer survival, which is supportive with the notion that cellular proliferation and immune response contribute to a significant portion of predictive power of prognostic classifiers. Our results demonstrate that the systems biology-based approach enables to identify common survival-associated genes.},

Relevant research studies aiming at the application of urine PCA3 level in PCa diagnosis were searched in PubMed, Embase, Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM), Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP, and Wan Fang databases independently, which were published up to May 8, 2014. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive diagnostic likelihood ratio (DLR+), negative diagnostic likelihood ratio (DLR-), diagnostic odds ratio, and the area under the summary receiver operating characteristic were used to evaluate the value of urine PCA3 in diagnosis of PCa by using the Meta-DiSc and STATA 12.0 statistical software. Sixteen research studies with a total 2,457 PCa patients and 4,236 control individuals were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, the results showed sensitivity and specificity of urine PCA3 in the diagnosis of PCa was 0.57 (95 % CI = 0.55-0.59), and 0.71 (95 % CI = 0.70-0.73), respectively. The DLR + and PLR - in the diagnosis of PCa were 2.12 (95 % CI = 1.89-2.38), and 0.55 (95 % CI = 0. 50-0.61), respectively. The pooled diagnostic odds ratio was 3.93 (95 % CI = 3.28-4.72). The area under the curve (AUCs) and *Q index estimate were 0.7118 and 0.6623, respectively. Urine PCA3 is a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of PCa.

abstract = {Many decisions in medicine involve trade-offs, such as between diagnosing patients with disease versus unnecessary additional testing for those who are healthy. Net benefit is an increasingly reported decision analytic measure that puts benefits and harms on the same scale. This is achieved by specifying an exchange rate, a clinical judgment of the relative value of benefits (such as detecting a cancer) and harms (such as unnecessary biopsy) associated with models, markers, and tests. The exchange rate can be derived by asking simple questions, such as the maximum number of patients a doctor would recommend for biopsy to find one cancer. As the answers to these sorts of questions are subjective, it is possible to plot net benefit for a range of reasonable exchange rates in a “decision curve.” For clinical prediction models, the exchange rate is related to the probability threshold to determine whether a patient is classified as being positive or negative for a disease. Net benefit is useful for determining whether basing clinical decisions on a model, marker, or test would do more good than harm. This is in contrast to traditional measures such as sensitivity, specificity, or area under the curve, which are statistical abstractions not directly informative about clinical value. Recent years have seen an increase in practical applications of net benefit analysis to research data. This is a welcome development, since decision analytic techniques are of particular value when the purpose of a model, marker, or test is to help doctors make better clinical decisions. #### Summary points},

Despite its increasing popularity, MTL algorithms are currently not available in the widely used software environment R, creating a bottleneck for their application in biomedical research. Results: We developed an efficient, easy-to-use R library for MTL (www.r-project.org) comprising 10 algorithms applicable for regression, classification, joint predictor selection, task clustering, low-rank learning and incorporation of biological networks. We demonstrate the utility of the algorithms using simulated data.

abstract = {Prostate cancer has the highest prevalence of any nonskin cancer in the human body, with similar likelihood of neoplastic foci found within the prostates of men around the world regardless of diet, occupation, lifestyle, or other factors. Essen¬tially all men with circulating androgens will develop microscopic prostate cancer if they live long enough. This review is a contemporary and comprehensive, literature-based analysis of the putative risk factors for human prostate cancer, and the results were presented at a multidisciplinary consensus conference held in Crystal City, Virginia, in the fall of 2002. The objectives were to evaluate known environmental factors and mechanisms of prostatic carcinogenesis and to identify existing data gaps and future research needs. The review is divided into four sections, including 1) epidemiology (endogenous factors [family history, hor¬mones, race, aging and oxidative stress] and exogenous factors [diet, environmen¬tal agents, occupation and other factors, including lifestyle factors]); 2) animal and cell culture models for prediction of human risk (rodent models, transgenic mod¬els, mouse reconstitution models, severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome mouse models, canine models, xenograft models, and cell culture models); 3) biomarkers in prostate cancer, most of which have been tested only as predictive factors for patient outcome after treatment rather than as risk factors; and 4) genotoxic and nongenotoxic mechanisms of carcinogenesis. The authors conclude that most of the data regarding risk relies, of necessity, on epidemiologic studies, but animal and cell culture models offer promise in confirming some important findings. The current understanding of biomarkers of disease and risk factors is limited. An understanding of the risk factors for prostate cancer has practical importance for public health research and policy, genetic and nutritional educa¬tion and chemoprevention, and prevention strategies},

abstract = {Context Many men with clinically localized prostate cancer are being monitored as part of active surveillance (AS) programs, but little is known about reasons for receiving radical treatment. Objectives A systematic review of the evidence about AS was undertaken, with a meta-analysis to identify predictors of radical treatment. Evidence acquisition A comprehensive search of the Embase, MEDLINE and Web of Knowledge databases to March 2014 was performed. Studies reporting on men with localized prostate cancer followed by AS or monitoring were included. AS was defined where objective eligibility criteria, management strategies, and triggers for clinical review or radical treatment were reported. Evidence synthesis The 26 AS cohorts included 7627 men, with a median follow-up of 3.5 yr (range of medians 1.5-7.5 yr). The cohorts had a wide range of inclusion criteria, monitoring protocols, and triggers for radical treatment. There were eight prostate cancer deaths and five cases of metastases in 24 981 person-years of follow-up. Each year, 8.8% of men (95% confidence interval 6.7-11.0%) received radical treatment, most commonly because of biopsy findings, prostate-specific antigen triggers, or patient choice driven by anxiety. Studies in which most men changed treatment were those including only low-risk Gleason score 6 disease and scheduled rebiopsies. Conclusions The wide variety of AS protocols and lack of robust evidence make firm conclusions difficult. Currently, patients and clinicians have to make judgments about the balance of risks and benefits in AS protocols. The publication of robust evidence from randomized trials and longer-term follow-up of cohorts is urgently required. Patient summary We reviewed 26 studies of men on active surveillance for prostate cancer. There was evidence that studies including men with the lowest risk disease and scheduled rebiopsy had higher rates of radical treatment.},

abstract = {Purpose: Prostate specific antigen based screening for prostate cancer has had a significant impact on the epidemiology of the disease. Its use has been associated with a significant decrease in prostate cancer mortality but has also resulted in the over diagnosis and overtreatment of indolent prostate cancer, exposing many men to the harms of treatment without benefit. The USPSTF (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force) in 2008 issued a recommendation against screening men older than 75 years, and in 2012 against routine screening for all men, indicating that in its interpretation the harms of screening outweigh the benefits. We review changes in the use of prostate specific antigen testing, performance of prostate biopsy, incidence of prostate cancer and stage of disease at presentation since 2012. Materials and Methods: An English language literature search was performed for terms that included "prostate specific antigen," "screening" and "United States Preventive Services Task Force" in various combinations. A total of 26 original studies had been published on the effects of the USPSTF recommendations on prostate specific antigen based screening or prostate cancer incidence in the United States as of December 1, 2016. Results: Review of the literature from 2012 through the end of 2016 indicates that there has been a decrease in prostate specific antigen testing and prostate biopsy. As a result, there has been a decline in the incidence of localized prostate cancer, including low, intermediate and high risk disease. The data regarding stage at presentation have yet to mature but there are some early signs of a shift toward higher burden of disease at presentation. Conclusions: These findings raise concern about a reversal of the observed improvement in prostate cancer specific mortality during preceding decades. Alternative screening strategies would 1) incorporate patient preferences by allowing shared decision-making, 2) preserve the survival benefits associated with screening, 3) improve the specificity of screening to reduce unnecessary biopsies and detection of low risk disease, and 4) promote the use of active surveillance for low risk cancers if they are detected.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Altered DNA methylation in CpG islands of gene promoters has been implicated in prostate cancer (PCa) progression and can be used to predict disease outcome. In this study, we determine whether methylation changes of androgen biosynthesis pathway (ABP)-related genes in patients' plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) can serve as prognostic markers for biochemical recurrence (BCR). METHODS: Methyl-binding domain capture sequencing (MBDCap-seq) was used to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in primary tumors of patients who subsequently developed BCR or not, respectively. Methylation pyrosequencing of candidate loci was validated in cfDNA samples of 86 PCa patients taken at and/or post-radical prostatectomy (RP) using univariate and multivariate prediction analyses. RESULTS: Putative DMRs in 13 of 30 ABP-related genes were found between tumors of BCR (n = 12) versus no evidence of disease (NED) (n = 15). In silico analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data confirmed increased DNA methylation of two loci-SRD5A2 and CYP11A1, which also correlated with their decreased expression, in tumors with subsequent BCR development. Their aberrant cfDNA methylation was also associated with detectable levels of PSA taken after patients' post-RP. Multivariate analysis of the change in cfDNA methylation at all of CpG sites measured along with patient's treatment history predicted if a patient will develop BCR with 77.5% overall accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, increased DNA methylation of SRD5A2 and CYP11A1 related to androgen biosynthesis functions may play a role in BCR after patients' RP. The correlation between aberrant cfDNA methylation and detectable PSA in post-RP further suggests their utility as predictive markers for PCa recurrence. .},

Similarly, of 262 patients diagnosed with Gleason 3 + 4 = 7 prostate cancer on initial biopsy, 60 (22.9%) were upgraded to Gleason score 4 + 3 = 7 or higher. • Tumours upgraded from Gleason 6 to 7 had a significantly lower index tumour volume (1.73 vs 2 mL, P= 0.029), higher calculated prostate volume (41.6 vs 39 mL, P= 0.017) and lower relative percentage of tumour to benign glandular tissue (4.3% vs 5.9%, P= 0.001) than tumours concordant for the higher grade. • Similarly, tumours that were Gleason score 3 + 4 on biopsy and upgraded on final pathology to 4 + 3 were significantly smaller as measured by both total tumour volume (2.3 vs 3.3 mL, P= 0.005) and index tumour volume (2.2 vs 3, P= 0.027) and occupied a smaller percentage of the gland volume (6.3% vs 8.9%, P= 0.017) compared with tumours concordant for the higher grade. • On multivariate analysis, lower prostate weight (hazard ratio 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.96-0.99, P < 0.001) and larger total tumour volume (hazard ratio 1.87, 95% confidence interval 1.4-2.6, P < 0.001) independently predicted an upgrade in Gleason score from 6 to 7. In tumours upgraded from biopsy Gleason 3 + 4, only higher index tumour volume (hazard ratio 3.1, 95% confidence interval 1.01-9.3, P= 0.048) was a significant predictor of upgrading on multivariate analysis.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: • Under-graded tumours are significantly smaller than tumours concordant for the higher grade, indicating that incomplete tumour sampling plays a significant role in Gleason score assignment error. • Surrogate measures of tumour volume may predict those at greatest risk of Gleason score upgrade.},

Surface modifications, whether used to acquire nutrients, defend against other microbes, or resist the pressures of a host immune system, facilitate adaptation to unique surroundings. The release of bioactive membrane vesicles (MVs) from the cell surface is conserved across microbial life, in bacteria, archaea, fungi, and parasites. MV production occurs not only in vitro but also in vivo during infection, underscoring the influence of these surface organelles in microbial physiology and pathogenesis through delivery of enzymes, toxins, communication signals, and antigens recognized by the innate and adaptive immune systems. Derived from a variety of organisms that span kingdoms of life and called by several names (membrane vesicles, outer membrane vesicles [OMVs], exosomes, shedding microvesicles, etc.), the conserved functions and mechanistic strategies of MV release are similar, including the use of ESCRT proteins and ESCRT protein homologues to facilitate these processes in archaea and eukaryotic microbes. Although forms of MV release by different organisms share similar visual, mechanistic, and functional features, there has been little comparison across microbial life. This underappreciated conservation of vesicle release, and the resulting functional impact throughout the tree of life, explored in this review, stresses the importance of vesicle-mediated processes throughout biology.},

abstract = {Prostate cancer screening is associated with low specificity, unnecessary biopsies, and overdiagnosis. We have previously shown that the Stockholm-3 model (S3M) can reduce biopsies compared with using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≥3. ng/ml as an indication for biopsy. Urologists in today's current prostate cancer testing (CPT) have access to numerous variables in addition to PSA (eg, age, ethnicity, family history, free PSA, PSA velocity, digital rectal examination, and prostate volume) to support biopsy decisions. We estimated the number of prostate cancers diagnosed and prostate biopsies performed if S3M replaced CPT in Stockholm, Sweden, by comparing biopsy results in 56 282 men who underwent PSA testing according to CPT in Stockholm in 2011 with the 47 688 men enrolled in the STHLM3 validation cohort 2012-2015. With the same sensitivity as CPT to diagnose Gleason score ≥7 prostate cancer, S3M was estimated to reduce the number of men biopsied by 53% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 41-65%), avoid 76% (95% CI: 67-81%) of negative biopsies, and reduce Gleason score 6 cancers by 23% (95% CI: 6-40%). S3M has the potential to improve prostate cancer diagnostics by better selecting men with high risk of GS ≥7 prostate cancer. Patient summary: We modeled the effect the Stockholm-3 model would have on prostate cancer diagnostics if it replaced current clinical practice. We found that Stockholm-3 model may substantially reduce the number of biopsies, while maintaining the same sensitivity to diagnose clinically significant prostate cancer. The Stockholm-3 prostate cancer risk-prediction model has the potential to improve prostate cancer screening by better selecting men with a high risk of Gleason score ≥7 prostate cancer, leading to a significant reduction in overdiagnosis and unnecessary prostate biopsies.},

abstract = {Background: Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) interpreted by experts is a powerful tool for diagnosing prostate cancer. However, the generalizability of published results across radiologists of varying expertise has not been verified. Objective: To assess variability in mpMRI reporting and diagnostic accuracy across radiologists of varying experience in routine clinical care. Design, setting, and participants: Men who underwent mpMRI and MR-fusion biopsy between 2014–2016. Each MRI scan was read by one of nine radiologists using the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PIRADS) and was not re-read before biopsy. Biopsy histopathology was the reference standard. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Outcomes were the PIRADS score distribution and diagnostic accuracy across nine radiologists. We evaluated the association between age, prostate-specific antigen, PIRADS score, and radiologist in predicting clinically significant cancer (Gleason ≥7) using multivariable logistic regression. We conducted sensitivity analyses for case volume and changes in accuracy over time. Results and limitations: We analyzed data for 409 subjects with 503 MRI lesions. While the number of lesions (mean 1.2 lesions/patient) did not differ across radiologists, substantial variation existed in PIRADS distribution and cancer yield. The significant cancer detection rate was 3–27% for PIRADS 3 lesions, 23–65% for PIRADS 4, and 40–80% for PIRADS 5 across radiologists. Some 13–60% of men with a PIRADS score of <3 on MRI harbored clinically significant cancer. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve varied from 0.69 to 0.81 for detection of clinically significant cancer. PIRADS score (p < 0.0001) and radiologist (p = 0.042) were independently associated with cancer in multivariable analysis. Neither individual radiologist volume nor study period impacted the results. MRI scans were not retrospectively re-read by all radiologists, precluding measurement of inter-observer agreement. Conclusions: We observed considerable variability in PIRADS score assignment and significant cancer yield across radiologists. We advise internal evaluation of mpMRI accuracy before widespread adoption. Patient summary: We evaluated the interpretation of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate in routine clinical care. Diagnostic accuracy depends on the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System score and the radiologist. In our study, the diagnostic accuracy of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) varied significantly across radiologists. We recommend internal evaluation of results before widespread adoption of MRI at individual medical centers.},

abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

abstract = {We assessed the effect of screening in the European Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) Rotterdam pilot 1 study cohort with men randomized in 1991-1992. A total of 1134 men were randomized on a 1:1 basis to a screening (S) and control (C) arm after prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing (PSA ≥10.0ng/ml was excluded from randomization). Further PSA testing was offered to all men in the S-arm with 4-yr intervals starting at age 55yr and screened up to the age of 74yr. Overall, a PSA level of ≥3.0ng/ml triggered biopsy. At time of analysis, 63% of men had died. Overall relative risk of metastatic (M+) disease and prostate cancer (PCa) death was 0.46 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.19-1.11) and 0.48 (95% CI: 0.17-1.36), respectively, in favor of screening. This ERSPC Rotterdam pilot 1 study cohort, screened in a period without noteworthy contamination, shows that PSA-based screening could result in considerable reductions of M+ disease and mortality which if confirmed in larger datasets should trigger further discussion on pros/cons of PCa screening. PATIENT SUMMARY: In a cohort with 19yr of follow-up, we found indications for a more substantial reduction in metastatic disease and cancer-specific mortality in favor of prostate cancer screening than previously reported. If confirmed in larger cohorts, these findings should be considered in the ongoing discussion on harms and benefits of prostate cancer screening.},

This book is a complete guide to the C4.5 system as implemented in C for the UNIX environment. It contains a comprehensive guide to the system's use , the source code (about 8,800 lines), and implementation notes. The source code and sample datasets are also available for download (see below). C4.5 starts with large sets of cases belonging to known classes. The cases, described by any mixture of nominal and numeric properties, are scrutinized for patterns that allow the classes to be reliably discriminated. These patterns are then expressed as models, in the form of decision trees or sets of if-then rules, that can be used to classify new cases, with emphasis on making the models understandable as well as accurate. The system has been applied successfully to tasks involving tens of thousands of cases described by hundreds of properties. The book starts from simple core learning methods and shows how they can be elaborated and extended to deal with typical problems such as missing data and over hitting. Advantages and disadvantages of the C4.5 approach are discussed and illustrated with several case studies. This book and software should be of interest to developers of classification- based intelligent systems and to students in machine learning and expert systems courses.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The optimal upper limit of the normal range for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is unknown. We investigated the prevalence of prostate cancer among men in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial who had a PSA level of 4.0 ng per milliliter or less. METHODS:Of 18,882 men enrolled in the prevention trial, 9459 were randomly assigned to receive placebo and had an annual measurement of PSA and a digital rectal examination. Among these 9459 men, 2950 men never had a PSA level of more than 4.0 ng per milliliter or an abnormal digital rectal examination, had a final PSA determination, and underwent a prostate biopsy after being in the study for seven years. RESULTS:Among the 2950 men (age range, 62 to 91 years), prostate cancer was diagnosed in 449 (15.2 percent); 67 of these 449 cancers (14.9 percent) had a Gleason score of 7 or higher. The prevalence of prostate cancer was 6.6 percent among men with a PSA level of up to 0.5 ng per milliliter, 10.1 percent among those with values of 0.6 to 1.0 ng per milliliter, 17.0 percent among those with values of 1.1 to 2.0 ng per milliliter, 23.9 percent among those with values of 2.1 to 3.0 ng per milliliter, and 26.9 percent among those with values of 3.1 to 4.0 ng per milliliter. The prevalence of high-grade cancers increased from 12.5 percent of cancers associated with a PSA level of 0.5 ng per milliliter or less to 25.0 percent of cancers associated with a PSA level of 3.1 to 4.0 ng per milliliter. CONCLUSIONS:Biopsy-detected prostate cancer, including high-grade cancers, is not rare among men with PSA levels of 4.0 ng per milliliter or less--levels generally thought to be in the normal range.},

abstract = {Non-biological experimental variation or "batch effects" are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes ( > 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

We want models to be not only good, but interpretable. And yet the task of interpretation appears underspecified. Papers provide diverse and sometimes non-overlapping motivations for interpretability, and offer myriad notions of what attributes render models interpretable. Despite this ambiguity, many papers proclaim interpretability axiomatically, absent further explanation. In this paper, we seek to refine the discourse on interpretability. First, we examine the motivations underlying interest in interpretability, finding them to be diverse and occasionally discordant. Then, we address model properties and techniques thought to confer interpretability, identifying transparency to humans and post-hoc explanations as competing notions. Throughout, we discuss the feasibility and desirability of different notions, and question the oft-made assertions that linear models are interpretable and that deep neural networks are not.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to determine whether a single result for total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA) can be used confidently to guide the need for prostate biopsy and by how much serial tPSA measurements must differ to be significant. tPSA measurements include both analytical and biological components of variation. The European Group on Tumor Markers conducted a literature survey to determine both the magnitude and impact of biological variation on single, the mean of replicate, and serial tPSA measurements. METHODS: The survey yielded 27 studies addressing the topic, and estimates for the biological variation of tPSA could be derived from 12 of these studies. RESULTS: The mean biological variation was 20% in the concentration range 0.1-20 microg/L for men over 50 years. The biological variation means that the one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) of the dispersion for a single tPSA result is approximately 33%. Three replicate samples with one analysis on each narrow the one-sided 95% CI for the mean concentration to approximately 20% and facilitate decisions on prostate biopsy. During monitoring of serial measurements, the change needed for significance is approximately 50% (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The biological variation of tPSA has implications for screening, diagnosis, and monitoring. Single measurements may not be sufficiently precise for screening and diagnosis. Replicate samples and calculation of the mean concentration may improve precision by reducing the dispersion. Monitoring of tPSA requires an estimate of either the change needed for significance or, alternatively, of the significance of the change.},

We focus on those bio markers that are most relevant for identifying patients who are likely to respond to a given therapy, as well as those biomarkers that are most effective for measuring patient response to therapy. These two measures are necessary for selecting the right drug for the right patient, regardless of whether the setting is in drug development or in the post‑approval use of the drug for patients with cancer. We also discuss the innovative designs of clinical trials and methodologies that are used to validate and qualify biomarkers for use in specific contexts. Furthermore, we look ahead to the promises and challenges in the field of cancer biomarkers.

Many drugs fail in late stages of develop-ment — often in Phase III trials — because of inadequate activity, lack of strategies for combating resistance to these drugs, unexpected safety issues or difficulties in determining efficacy because of reasons that include confounded outcomes of clinical trials.

Methods: In this randomised phase 3 trial, men aged 50-69 years registered at 337 primary care centres in nine UK cities were invited to attend a specialist nurse appointment for a serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test. Prostate biopsies were offered to men with a PSA concentration of 3{\textperiodcentered}0 $\mu$g/L or higher. Consenting participants with clinically localised prostate cancer were randomly assigned to active monitoring (surveillance strategy), radical prostatectomy, or three-dimensional conformal external-beam radiotherapy by a computer-generated allocation system. Randomisation was stratified by site (minimised for differences in participant age, PSA results, and Gleason score). The primary endpoint is prostate cancer mortality at a median 10-year follow-up, ascertained by an independent committee, which will be analysed by intention to treat in 2016. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02044172, and as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN20141297. Findings: Between Oct 1, 2001, and Jan 20, 2009, 228 966 men were invited to attend an appointment with a specialist nurse. Of the invited men, 100 444 (44%) attended their initial appointment and 82 429 (82%) of attenders had a PSA test. PSA concentration was below the biopsy threshold in 73 538 (89%) men. Of the 8566 men with a PSA concentration of 3{\textperiodcentered}0-19{\textperiodcentered}9 $\mu$g/L, 7414 (87%) underwent biopsies. 2896 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer (4% of tested men and 39% of those who had a biopsy), of whom 2417 (83%) had clinically localised disease (mostly T1c, Gleason score 6). With the addition of 247 pilot study participants recruited between 1999 and 2001, 2664 men were eligible for the treatment trial and 1643 (62%) agreed to be randomly assigned (545 to active monitoring, 545 to radiotherapy, and 553 to radical prostatectomy). Clinical and sociodemographic characteristics of randomly assigned participants were balanced across treatment groups. Interpretation: The ProtecT trial randomly assigned 1643 men with localised prostate cancer to active monitoring, radiotherapy, or surgery. Participant clinicopathological features are more consistent with contemporary patient characteristics than in previous prostate cancer treatment trials.

abstract = {Background Despite salvage radiation therapy (SRT) for recurrent prostate cancer (PCa) after radical prostatectomy (RP), some patients still progress to metastases. Identifying these men would allow them to undergo systemic therapy including testing novel therapies to reduce metastases risk. Objective To test whether the genomic classifier (GC) predicts development of metastatic disease. Design, setting, and participants Retrospective multi-center and multi-ethnic cohort study from two academic centers and one Veterans Affairs Medical Center in the United States involving 170 men receiving SRT for recurrent PCa post-RP. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Time from SRT to development of metastatic disease tested using Cox regression, survival c-index, and decision curve analysis. Performance of GC was compared to the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Score and Briganti risk models based on these metrics. Results and limitations With a median 5.7 yr follow-up after SRT, 20 patients (12%) developed metastases. On multivariable analysis, for each 0.1 unit increase in GC (scaled from 0 to 1), the hazard ratio for metastasis was 1.58 (95% confidence interval 1.16–2.17; p = 0.002). Adjusting for androgen deprivation therapy did not materially change the results. The c-index for GC was 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.73–0.88) versus 0.63–0.65 for published clinico-pathologic risk models. The 5-yr cumulative incidence of metastasis post-SRT in patients with low, intermediate, and high GC scores was 2.7%, 8.4%, and 33.1%, respectively (p < 0.001). Conclusions While validation in larger, prospectively collected cohorts is required, these data suggest GC is a strong predictor of metastases among men receiving SRT for recurrent PCa post-RP, accurately identifying men who are excellent candidates for systemic therapy due to their very high-risk of metastases. Patient summary Genomic classifier and two clinico-pathologic risk models were evaluated on their ability to predict metastases among men receiving salvage radiation therapy for recurrent prostate cancer. Genomic classifier was able to identify candidates for further therapies due to their very high-risk of metastases.},

abstract = {Urinary exosomes or microvesicles are being studied intensively to identify potential new biomarkers for renal disease. We sought to identify whether these microvesicles contain nucleic acids. We isolated microvesicles from human urine in the same density range as that previously described for urinary exosomes and found them to have an RNA integrity profile similar to that of kidney tissue, including 18S and 28S rRNA. This profile was better preserved in urinary microvesicles compared with whole cells isolated from urine, suggesting that microvesicles may protect RNA during urine passage. We were able to detect mRNA in the human urinary microvesicles encoding proteins from all regions of the nephron and the collecting duct. Further, to provide a proof of principle, we found that microvesicles isolated from the urine of the V-ATPase B1 subunit knockout mice lacked mRNA of this subunit while containing a normal amount of the B2 subunit and aquaporin 2. The microvesicles were found to be contaminated with extraneous DNA potentially on their surface; therefore, we developed a rapid and reliable means to isolate nucleic acids from within urine microvesicles devoid of this extraneous contamination. Our study provides an experimental strategy for the routine isolation and use of urinary microvesicles as a novel and non-invasive source of nucleic acids to further renal disease biomarker discovery.},

abstract = {Bladder cancer is diagnosed by cystoscopy, a costly and invasive procedure that is associated with patient discomfort. Analysis of tumor-specific markers in DNA from sediments of voided urine has the potential for non-invasive detection of bladder cancer; however, the sensitivity is limited by low fractions and small numbers of tumor cells exfoliated into the urine from low-grade tumors. The purpose of this study was to improve the sensitivity for non-invasive detection of bladder cancer by size-based capture and enrichment of tumor cells in urine. In a split-sample set-up, urine from a consecutive series of patients with primary or recurrent bladder tumors (N = 189) was processed by microfiltration using a membrane filter with a defined pore-size, and sedimentation by centrifugation, respectively. DNA from the samples was analyzed for seven bladder tumor-associated methylation markers using MethyLight and pyrosequencing assays. The fraction of tumor-derived DNA was higher in the filter samples than in the corresponding sediments for all markers (p<0.000001). Across all tumor stages, the number of cases positive for one or more markers was 87% in filter samples compared to 80% in the corresponding sediments. The largest increase in sensitivity was achieved in low-grade Ta tumors, with 82 out of 98 cases positive in the filter samples (84%) versus 74 out of 98 in the sediments (75%). Our results show that pre-analytic processing of voided urine by size-based filtration can increase the sensitivity for DNA-based detection of bladder cancer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The natural history of prostate cancer is highly variable and it is difficult to predict. We showed previously that a cell cycle progression (CCP) score was a robust predictor of outcome in a conservatively managed cohort diagnosed by transurethral resection of the prostate. A greater need is to predict outcome in patients diagnosed by needle biopsy.\n\nMETHODS: Total RNA was extracted from paraffin specimens. A CCP score was calculated from expression levels of 31 genes. Clinical variables consisted of centrally re-reviewed Gleason score, baseline prostate-specific antigen level, age, clinical stage, and extent of disease. The primary endpoint was death from prostate cancer.\n\nRESULTS: In univariate analysis (n=349), the hazard ratio (HR) for death from prostate cancer was 2.02 (95% CI (1.62, 2.53), P<10(-9)) for a one-unit increase in CCP score. The CCP score was only weakly correlated with standard prognostic factors and in a multivariate analysis, CCP score dominated (HR for one-unit increase=1.65, 95% CI (1.31, 2.09), P=3 × 10(-5)), with Gleason score (P=5 × 10(-4)) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (P=0.017) providing significant additional contributions.\n\nCONCLUSION: For conservatively managed patients, the CCP score is the strongest independent predictor of cancer death outcome yet described and may prove valuable in managing clinically localised prostate cancer.},

The hypotheses proposed examined whether microarray measurements of gene expression either alone or combined with basic clinical covariates (stage, age, sex) could be used to predict overall survival in lung cancer subjects. Several models examined produced risk scores that substantially correlated with actual subject outcome. Most methods performed better with clinical data, supporting the combined use of clinical and molecular information when building prognostic models for early-stage lung cancer. This study also provides the largest available set of microarray data with extensive pathological and clinical annotation for lung adenocarcinomas.},

abstract = {The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},

abstract = {Among the estimated 230,000 men diagnosed with prostate cancer in the US each year there has been a rise in the number of radical prostatectomies (RP). There is some debate over the value of immediate adjuvant therapy following RP in men with high-risk pathological features versus delayed salvage radiation therapy when signs of disease progression are observed. Thus, it would be potentially useful to inform post-RP management strategies by more clearly identifying those patients at higher risk of progression and death from prostate cancer. A 22 gene-expression assay, Decipher (GenomeDx Biosciences), has been developed in men treated with radical prostatectomy to predict the five-year risk of metastatic prostate cancer. Published and unpublished literature was evaluated to determine the analytic validity, clinical validity and clinical utility of Decipher. Limited information is available on the analytic validity of Decipher. In both discovery and validation studies, Decipher was shown to have good performance in discriminating men with metastasis from men without metastasis five years after surgery (AUC 0.75 to 0.90). In terms of clinical utility, no evidence was found reporting improved outcomes (lower prostate cancer specific mortality and treatment related adverse effects) from using this test to guide post-operative treatment. Four studies provided weak indirect evidence of clinical utility in which 31% to 43% of post-operative treatment recommendations were changed in men with high-risk prostate cancer based on test results, with 27% to 52% of treatment recommendations changing from any treatment to no treatment.},

abstract = {Purpose: To describe the anatomic features of the central zone of the prostate on T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) images and evaluate the diagnostic performance of MR imaging in detection of central zone involvement by prostate cancer. Materials and Methods: The institutional review board waived informed consent and approved this retrospective, HIPAA-compliant study of 211 patients who underwent T2-weighted and DW MR imaging of the prostate before radical prostatectomy. Whole-mount step-section pathologic findings were the reference standard. Two radiologists independently recorded the visibility, MR signal intensity, size, and symmetry of the central zone and scored the likelihood of central zone involvement by cancer on T2-weighted MR images and on T2-weighted MR images plus apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps generated from the DW MR images. Descriptive summary statistics were calculated for central zone imaging features. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve were used to evaluate reader performance in detecting central zone involvement. Results: For readers 1 and 2, the central zone was visible, at least partially, in 177 (84%) and 170 (81%) of 211 patients, respectively. The most common imaging appearance of the central zone was symmetric, homogeneous low signal intensity. Cancers involving the central zone had higher prostate-specific antigen values, Gleason scores, and rates of extracapsular extension and seminal vesicle invasion compared with cancers not involving the central zone (P < .05). Area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity in detecting central zone involvement were 0.70, 0.30, and 0.96 for reader 1 and 0.65, 0.35, and 0.93 for reader 2, and these values did not differ significantly between T2-weighted imaging and T2-weighted imaging plus ADC maps. Conclusion: The central zone was visualized in most patients. Cancers involving the central zone were associated with more aggressive disease than those without central zone involvement. {\textcopyright} RSNA, 2012.},

abstract = {by David R. Thurtle, David C. Greenberg, Lui S. Lee, Hong H. Huang, Paul D. Pharoah, Vincent J. Gnanapragasam Background Prognostic stratification is the cornerstone of management in nonmetastatic prostate cancer (PCa). However, existing prognostic models are inadequate—often using treatment outcomes rather than survival, stratifying by broad heterogeneous groups and using heavily treated cohorts. To address this unmet need, we developed an individualised prognostic model that contextualises PCa-specific mortality (PCSM) against other cause mortality, and estimates the impact of treatment on survival. Methods and findings Using records from the United Kingdom National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS), data were collated for 10,089 men diagnosed with nonmetastatic PCa between 2000 and 2010 in Eastern England. Median follow-up was 9.8 years with 3,829 deaths (1,202 PCa specific). Totals of 19.8%, 14.1%, 34.6%, and 31.5% of men underwent conservative management, prostatectomy, radiotherapy (RT), and androgen deprivation monotherapy, respectively. A total of 2,546 men diagnosed in Singapore over a similar time period represented an external validation cohort. Data were randomly split 70:30 into model development and validation cohorts. Fifteen-year PCSM and non-PCa mortality (NPCM) were explored using separate multivariable Cox models within a competing risks framework. Fractional polynomials (FPs) were utilised to fit continuous variables and baseline hazards. Model accuracy was assessed by discrimination and calibration using the Harrell C-index and chi-squared goodness of fit, respectively, within both validation cohorts. A multivariable model estimating individualised 10- and 15-year survival outcomes was constructed combining age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), histological grade, biopsy core involvement, stage, and primary treatment, which were each independent prognostic factors for PCSM, and age and comorbidity, which were prognostic for NPCM. The model demonstrated good discrimination, with a C-index of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.82–0.86) and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.80–0.87) for 15-year PCSM in the UK and Singapore validation cohorts, respectively, comparing favourably to international risk-stratification criteria. Discrimination was maintained for overall mortality, with C-index 0.77 (95% CI: 0.75–0.78) and 0.76 (95% CI: 0.73–0.78). The model was well calibrated with no significant difference between predicted and observed PCa-specific (p = 0.19) or overall deaths (p = 0.43) in the UK cohort. Key study limitations were a relatively small external validation cohort, an inability to account for delayed changes to treatment beyond 12 months, and an absence of tumour-stage subclassifications. Conclusions 'PREDICT Prostate' is an individualised multivariable PCa prognostic model built from baseline diagnostic information and the first to our knowledge that models potential treatment benefits on overall survival. Prognostic power is high despite using only routinely collected clinicopathological information.},

abstract = {A number of supervised learning methods have been introduced in the last decade. Unfortunately, the last comprehensive empirical evaluation of supervised learning was the Statlog Project in the early 90's. We present a large-scale empirical comparison between ten supervised learning methods: SVMs, neural nets, logistic regression, naive bayes, memory-based learning, random forests, decision trees, bagged trees, boosted trees, and boosted stumps. We also examine the effect that calibrating the models via Platt Scaling and Isotonic Regression has on their performance. An important aspect of our study is the use of a variety of performance criteria to evaluate the learning methods. 1.},

abstract = {In the 1980s, exosomes were described as vesicles of endosomal origin secreted from reticulocytes. Interest increased around these extracellular vesicles, as they appeared to participate in several cellular processes. Exosomes bear proteins, lipids, and RNAs, mediating intercellular communication between different cell types in the body, and thus affecting normal and pathological conditions. Only recently, scientists acknowledged the difficulty of separating exosomes from other types of extracellular vesicles, which precludes a clear attribution of a particular function to the different types of secreted vesicles. To shed light into this complex but expanding field of science, this review focuses on the definition of exosomes and other secreted extracellular vesicles. Their biogenesis, their secretion, and their subsequent fate are discussed, as their functions rely on these important processes.},

abstract = {Background Men with high serum prostate specific antigen usually undergo transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TRUS-biopsy). TRUS-biopsy can cause side-effects including bleeding, pain, and infection. Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MP-MRI) used as a triage test might allow men to avoid unnecessary TRUS-biopsy and improve diagnostic accuracy. Methods We did this multicentre, paired-cohort, confirmatory study to test diagnostic accuracy of MP-MRI and TRUS-biopsy against a reference test (template prostate mapping biopsy [TPM-biopsy]). Men with prostate-specific antigen concentrations up to 15 ng/mL, with no previous biopsy, underwent 1{\textperiodcentered}5 Tesla MP-MRI followed by both TRUS-biopsy and TPM-biopsy. The conduct and reporting of each test was done blind to other test results. Clinically significant cancer was defined as Gleason score ≥4 + 3 or a maximum cancer core length 6 mm or longer. This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01292291. Findings Between May 17, 2012, and November 9, 2015, we enrolled 740 men, 576 of whom underwent 1{\textperiodcentered}5 Tesla MP-MRI followed by both TRUS-biopsy and TPM-biopsy. On TPM-biopsy, 408 (71%) of 576 men had cancer with 230 (40%) of 576 patients clinically significant. For clinically significant cancer, MP-MRI was more sensitive (93%, 95% CI 88–96%) than TRUS-biopsy (48%, 42–55%; p<0{\textperiodcentered}0001) and less specific (41%, 36–46% for MP-MRI vs 96%, 94–98% for TRUS-biopsy; p<0{\textperiodcentered}0001). 44 (5{\textperiodcentered}9%) of 740 patients reported serious adverse events, including 8 cases of sepsis. Interpretation Using MP-MRI to triage men might allow 27% of patients avoid a primary biopsy and diagnosis of 5% fewer clinically insignificant cancers. If subsequent TRUS-biopsies were directed by MP-MRI findings, up to 18% more cases of clinically significant cancer might be detected compared with the standard pathway of TRUS-biopsy for all. MP-MRI, used as a triage test before first prostate biopsy, could reduce unnecessary biopsies by a quarter. MP-MRI can also reduce over-diagnosis of clinically insignificant prostate cancer and improve detection of clinically significant cancer.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES To evaluate the histopathological results after radical prostatectomy (RP) in patients that had normal preoperative multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), in order to determine whether they had significant or insignificant disease. Moreover, we evaluated the influence of the expertise of the radiologist on the results. PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively included patients who underwent RP in our centre and who had a preoperative negative mpMRI. The MRIs were considered negative when no suspicious lesion was seen or when the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 1 score was <7. We used Pathological tumour-node-metastasis staging and Gleason score on pathology reports, and whole-mount sections to calculate tumour volume. RESULTS We identified 101 patients from 2009 to 2015. Final pathology showed that 16.9% had extraprostatic extension, 13.8% had primary Gleason pattern 4 (4 + 3 and above), 47.5% had secondary Gleason pattern 4 or 5, and 55.9% and 20.6% had a main tumour volume of ≥0.5 and ≥2 mL, respectively. When limiting the analysis to expert reading only, the numbers improved: only one patient (3.4%) had extraprostatic extension (P < 0.05), one patient (3.4%) had primary Gleason pattern 4 (P = 0.05), and 64.7% and 5.9% had a main tumour volume of ≥0.5 and ≥2 mL, respectively (P = 0.01).

abstract = {In developed countries, prostate cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer, and the third most common cause of death from cancer in men. Apart from age and ethnic origin, a positive family history is probably the strongest known risk factor. Clinically, prostate cancer is diagnosed as local or advanced, and treatments range from surveillance to radical local treatment or androgen-deprivation treatment. Androgen deprivation reduces symptoms in about 70–80% of patients with advanced prostate cancer, but most tumours relapse within 2 years to an incurable androgen-independent state. The recorded incidence of prostate cancer has substantially increased in the past two decades, probably because of the introduction of screening with prostate-specific antigen, the use of improved biopsy techniques for diagnosis, and increased public awareness. Trends in mortality from the disease are less clearcut. Mortality changes are not of the same magnitude as the changes in incidence, and in some countries mortality has been stable or even decreased. The disparity between reported incidence and mortality rates leads to the probable conclusion that only a small proportion of diagnosed low-risk prostate cancers will progress to life-threatening disease during the lifetime of the patient.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine whether pretreatment risk groups shown to predict time to prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) after treatment at a single institution retained that ability in a multi-institutional setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1988 to 2002, 7,316 patients treated in the United States at 44 institutions with either surgery (n = 4,946) or radiation (n = 2,370) for clinical stage T1c-2, N0 or NX, M0 prostate cancer made up the study cohort. A Cox regression analysis was performed to determine the ability of pretreatment risk groups to predict time to PCSM after treatment. The relative risk (RR) of PCSM and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the intermediate- and high-risk groups relative to the low-risk group. RESULTS: Estimates of non-PCSM 8 years after prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure were 4% v 15% (surgery versus radiation; Plog rank =.002) compared with 13% v 18% (surgery versus radiation; Plog rank =.35) for patients whose age at the time of PSA failure was less than 70 as compared with >or= 70 years, respectively. The RR of PCSM after treatment for surgery-managed patients with high- or intermediate-risk disease was 14.2 (95% CI, 5.0 to 23.4; PCox <.0001) and 4.9 (95% CI, 1.7 to 8.1; PCox =.0037), respectively. These values were 14.3 (95% CI, 5.2 to 24.0; PCox <.0001) and 5.6 (95% CI, 2.0 to 9.3; PCox =.0012) for radiation-managed patients. CONCLUSION: This study provided evidence to support the prediction of time to PCSM after surgery or radiation on the basis of pretreatment risk groups for patients with clinically localized prostate cancer managed during the PSA era.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) and TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion are promising prostate cancer (PCa) specific biomarkers. Our aim was to simultaneously quantify the expression levels of PCA3 and TMPRSS2:ERG in a panel of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), normal prostate adjacent to PCa (NP) and PCa tissue samples, to provide a rational basis for the understanding of the false-positive and false-negative results of the urine assays. METHODS: The tissue samples were carefully histopathologically characterized to obtain homogeneous groups. The mRNA was isolated, transcribed into cDNA and the relative expressions of PCA3 and TMPRSS2:ERG were measured using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The expression levels of PCA3 and TMPRSS2:ERG were compared between the different groups. RESULTS: We included 48 BPH, 32 NP, and 48 PCa. The PCA3 expression levels progressively increased from BPH to NP (3 times) and finally to PCa (30 times). There were one false-positive sample and seven false-negative samples. The TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion was found in 8.3% of the BPH, 15.6% of the NP, and 50% of the PCa samples. The use of TMPRSS2:ERG in the PCA3 negative cases allowed diagnosis of four of the seven false-negative samples and added one false-positive, but we had to define a cut-off value to avoid eight false-positive results. CONCLUSIONS: Considering tissue expression of the markers, most of the false-negative results of the PCA3 test were corrected by TMPRSS2:ERG (57%) and the combination of both had a higher sensitivity for PCa diagnosis. Some of the control samples did express TMPRSS2:ERG and a cut-off value had to be defined to avoid false-positive results.},

abstract = {Predictive modeling in medicine involves the development of computational models which are capable of analysing large amounts of data in order to predict healthcare outcomes for individual patients. Computational intelligence approaches are suitable when the data to be modelled are too complex for conventional statistical techniques to process quickly and efficiently. These advanced approaches are based on mathematical models that have been especially developed for dealing with the uncertainty and imprecision which is typically found in clinical and biological datasets. This paper provides a survey of recent work on computational intelligence approaches that have been applied to prostate cancer predictive modeling, and considers the challenges which need to be addressed. In particular, the paper considers a broad definition of computational intelligence which includes metaheuristic optimisation algorithms (also known as nature inspired algorithms), Artificial Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Fuzzy based approaches, and hybrids of these, as well as Bayesian based approaches, and Markov models. Metaheuristic optimisation approaches, such as the Ant Colony Optimisation, Particle Swarm Optimisation, and Artificial Immune Network have been utilised for optimising the performance of prostate cancer predictive models, and the suitability of these approaches are discussed.},

A panel of four kallikrein markers (total PSA, free PSA, intact PSA, and kallikrein-related peptidase 2) is a highly accurate predictor of biopsy outcome. The clinical significance of biopsy-detectable cancers in men classified as low-risk by this panel remains unclear.\n\nMETHODS: The Malm{\"{o}} Diet and Cancer study is a population-based cohort of 11,063 Swedish men aged 45 to 73 providing a blood sample at baseline during 1991-1996. The Swedish Cancer Registry was used to identify 943 men diagnosed with prostate cancer by December 31, 2006. PSA testing was low. We assessed the predictive accuracy of our published statistical model to predict subsequent prostate cancer diagnosis in men with a total PSA level of 3.0 ng/mL or more at baseline.\n\nRESULTS: Compared with total PSA and age, the full kallikrein panel enhanced the predictive accuracy for clinically diagnosed prostate cancer (concordance index 0.65 vs. 0.75; P < 0.001). For every 1,000 men with a total PSA level of 3 ng/mL or more at baseline, the model would classify as high-risk 131 of 152 (86%) of the cancer cases diagnosed clinically within 5 years; 421 men would be classified as low-risk by the panel and recommended against biopsy. Of these, only 2 would be diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer (clinical T3-T4 or metastases) within 5 years.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Men with a PSA level of 3 ng/mL or more but defined as low-risk by the panel of four kallikrein markers are unlikely to develop incurable prostate cancer.\n\nIMPACT: Use of the panel to determine referral to biopsy could substantially reduce the number of unnecessary prostate biopsies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUNDGenomic instability resulting in copy number variation is a hallmark of malignant transformation and may be identified through massive parallel sequencing. Tumor-specific cell free DNA (cfDNA) present in serum and plasma provides a real-time, easily accessible surrogate. METHODSDNA was extracted from serum of 204 patients with prostate cancer (Gleason score 2-10), 207 male controls, and patients with benign hyperplasia (n = 10) and prostatitis (n = 10). DNA was amplified by use of random primers, tagged with molecular identifiers, sequenced on a SOLID system, and aligned to the human genome. We evaluated the number of sequence reads of cfDNA in sliding 100-kbp intervals for variation from controls. We used chromosomal regions with significant variations in alignment hits for their ability to segregate patients and matched controls. RESULTSUsing ROC curves to assess diagnostic performance, we evaluated the number of regions in a first subset (n = 177), with variations in alignment hits alone, provided an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.81 (95% CI 0.7-0.9, P < 0.001). Using 5 rounds of 10-fold cross-validation with the full data set, we established a final model that discriminated prostate cancer from controls with an AUC of 0.92 (0.87-0.95), reaching a diagnostic accuracy of 83%. Both benign prostatic hypertrophy and prostatitis could be distinguished from prostate cancer by use of cfDNA, with an accuracy of 90%. CONCLUSIONSAssessment of a limited number of chromosomal structural instabilities by use of massive parallel sequencing of cfDNA was sufficient to distinguish between prostate cancer and controls. This large cohort demonstrates the utility of cfDNA in prostate cancer recently established in other malignant neoplasms.},

This suggests that the information theoretical variables might be a criterion for determining the number of layers in deep learning without fine-tuning that requires high computational loads.},

Accordingly, EVs play an essential role in both primary tumor growth and metastatic evolution. EVs orchestrate multiple systemic pathophysiological processes, such as coagulation, vascular leakiness, and reprogramming of stromal recipient cells to support pre-metastatic niche formation and subsequent metastasis. Clinically, EVs may be biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets for cancer progression, particularly for predicting and preventing future metastatic development.},

abstract = {Prediction without justification has limited applicability. As a remedy, we learn to extract pieces of input text as justifications -- rationales -- that are tailored to be short and coherent, yet sufficient for making the same prediction. Our approach combines two modular components, generator and encoder, which are trained to operate well together. The generator specifies a distribution over text fragments as candidate rationales and these are passed through the encoder for prediction. Rationales are never given during training. Instead, the model is regularized by desiderata for rationales. We evaluate the approach on multi-aspect sentiment analysis against manually annotated test cases. Our approach outperforms attention-based baseline by a significant margin. We also successfully illustrate the method on the question retrieval task.},

abstract = {PURPOSE Active surveillance (AS) is a treatment option for men with very low-risk prostate cancer (PCa); however, favorable outcomes achieved for men in AS are based on cohorts that under-represent African American (AA) men. To explore whether race-based health disparities exist among men with very low-risk PCa, we evaluated oncologic outcomes of AA men with very low-risk PCa who were candidates for AS but elected to undergo radical prostatectomy (RP). PATIENTS AND METHODS We studied 1,801 men (256 AA, 1,473 white men, and 72 others) who met National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria for very low-risk PCa and underwent RP. Presenting characteristics, pathologic data, and cancer recurrence were compared among the groups. Multivariable modeling was performed to assess the association of race with upgrading and adverse pathologic features. RESULTS AA men with very low-risk PCa had more adverse pathologic features at RP and poorer oncologic outcomes. AA men were more likely to experience disease upgrading at prostatectomy (27.3% v 14.4%; P < .001), positive surgical margins (9.8% v 5.9%; P = .02), and higher Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Post-Surgical scoring system (CAPRA-S) scores. On multivariable analysis, AA race was an independent predictor of adverse pathologic features (odds ratio, [OR], 3.23; P = .03) and pathologic upgrading (OR, 2.26; P = .03). CONCLUSION AA men with very low-risk PCa who meet criteria for AS but undergo immediate surgery experience significantly higher rates of upgrading and adverse pathology than do white men and men of other races. AA men with very low-risk PCa should be counseled about increased oncologic risk when deciding among their disease management options.},

abstract = {The Gleason system for prostate cancer was based on a study of 270 patients from the Minneapolis Veterans Administration Hospital in 1966-1967. In 1974, Gleason and the Veterans Administrative Cooperative Urological Research Group expanded this study to 1032 men. These studies formed the basis of the Gleason grading system, which is now endorsed as the primary grading system for prostate cancer by the World Health Organization, the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology Fascicle on prostate cancer, the Association of Directors of Anatomic and Surgical Pathology, and the College of American Pathologists. In the nearly 40 years since its inception, several aspects about prostate cancer and its management have changed, most notably serum prostate-specific antigen, transrectal ultrasonography, 18-gauge needle biopsy sampling, immunohistochemistry for the diagnosis of cancer, and radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy as primary treatment modalities. Several aspects of the disease, and consequently the reporting needs, have changed such as reporting cancer on multiple cases in needle biopsies, multiple nodules in prostatectomy, tertiary patterns, variants and variations in prostate cancer. The application of the Gleason system, therefore, has varied considerably in contemporary surgical pathology practice. An International Consensus Conference attended by 80 urologic pathologists from 20 countries was convened to discuss clarifications and modifications to the Gleason system. This article serves as a brief overview and summary of the proceedings that have been published in detail in recent literature.},

abstract = {Recent studies suggest that tumor-derived microvesicles (MV) act as a vehicle for exchange of genetic information between tumor and stromal cells, engendering a favorable microenvironment for cancer development. Within the tumor mass, all cell types may contribute to MV shedding, but specific contributions to tumor progression have yet to be established. Here we report that a subset of tumor-initiating cells expressing the mesenchymal stem cell marker CD105 in human renal cell carcinoma releases MVs that trigger angiogenesis and promote the formation of a premetastatic niche. MVs derived only from CD105-positive cancer stem cells conferred an activated angiogenic phenotype to normal human endothelial cells, stimulating their growth and vessel formation after in vivo implantation in immunocompromised severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Furthermore, treating SCID mice with MVs shed from CD105-positive cells greatly enhanced lung metastases induced by i.v. injection of renal carcinoma cells. Molecular characterization of CD105-positive MVs defines a set of proangiogenic mRNAs and microRNAs implicated in tumor progression and metastases. Our results define a specific source of cancer stem cell-derived MVs that contribute to triggering the angiogenic switch and coordinating metastatic diffusion during tumor progression.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES\nHigh-resolution prostate imaging may allow for detection of subtle changes in tumor size, decrease the reliance on biopsies, and help define tumor boundaries during ablation. This pilot clinical trial evaluates a novel high-resolution prostate MRI for detection of small, biopsy-proven prostate tumors. \n\nMETHODS\nOur team developed a software that can be loaded on any modern MRI to generate high resolution diffusion-weighted imaging sequences (HR-DWI), which were compared to standard diffusion-weighted imaging sequence (S-DWI) in a prospective pilot trial in active surveillance patients. HR-DWI captures the entire volume of the prostate rather than sections, reducing streaking artifacts and geometric distortions. Multiple shots, rather than single shots, are used to differentiate signal and noise, enhancing resolution. All images were read by two radiologists. The primary outcome was the percent of biopsy-proven zones seen in 17 patients. The trial was powered to detect discordant proportions of 0.04 and 0.40 at one-sided alpha=0.05. \n\nRESULTS\nThe resolution was defined using standard phantoms. HR-DWI produced a 5-fold improvement in spatial resolution when compared to S-DWI. Multiparametric (MP)-MRI incorporating S-DWI was useful for predicting biopsy results (AUC 0.72, Fisher's exact p<0.001); however, using HR-DWI allowed MP-MRI to be more highly predictive of biopsy results (AUC 0.88, Fisher's exact p<0.001). AUC for MP-MRI incorporating HR-DWI was significantly larger than MP-MRI incorporating S-DWI (p=0.002). MP-MRI with HR-DWI had a sensitivity of 95.7% and identified tumor in 22 of 23 zones proven to have cancer on biopsy. In contrast, MP-MRI with S-DWI had a sensitivity of 60.9% and only identified 14 of 23 biopsy-positive zones (p=0.004). \n\nCONCLUSION\nWe developed a novel DWI and evaluated its improved resolution in a clinical setting. This technology has many potential applications and should be evaluated in future clinical trials as a patient management tool.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) is a novel preoperative index which predicts the risk of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy. The performance of the index is at least as good as the best available instruments based on clinical variables, and the 0 to 10 score is simple to calculate for both clinical and research purposes. This study used a large external dataset to validate CAPRA.\n\nMETHODS: Data were abstracted from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database, a registry of men who underwent radical prostatectomy at 4 Veterans Affairs and 1 active military medical center. Of 2096 men in the database, 1346 (64%) had full data available to calculate the CAPRA score. Performance of the CAPRA score was assessed with proportional hazards regression, survival analysis, and the concordance (c) index.\n\nRESULTS: Of the studied patients, 41% were non-Caucasian, and their mean age was 62 years. Twenty-six percent suffered recurrence; median follow-up among patients who did not recur was 34 months. The hazard ratio (HR) for each 1-point increase in CAPRA was 1.39 (95% CI [confidence interval], 1.31-1.46). The 5-year recurrence-free survival rate ranged from 86% for CAPRA 0-1 patients to 21% for CAPRA 7-10 patients. Increasing CAPRA scores were significantly associated with increasing risk of adverse pathologic outcomes. The c-index for CAPRA for the validation set was 0.68, compared with 0.66 for the original development set.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The UCSF-CAPRA accurately predicted both biochemical and pathologic outcomes after radical prostatectomy among a large, diverse, cohort of men. These results validated the effectiveness of this powerful and straightforward instrument.},

abstract = {Context The optimal management of screen-detected, localised prostate cancer remains controversial, related to overtreatment issues of screening and the nonrandomised evidence base. Active surveillance (AS) aims to delay or avoid curative therapy but may potentially harm patients' well-being through living with untreated prostate cancer. Objective To systematically review the literature on quality of life (QoL) in patients undergoing AS. Evidence acquisition Embase, Medline, Psychinfo, Cochrane Central, Web of Science, and PubMed databases were searched in May 2014 using quality of life, active surveillance, prostate cancer, their synonyms, and targeted manual searches. The psychological dimensions related to health-related QoL (HRQoL) outcomes were anxiety and depression, distress, decisional conflict, and mental health. Evidence synthesis Ten clinical and research-based AS studies worldwide measured HRQoL and related psychological facets in six cross-sectional studies and four cohorts (follow-up: 9-36 mo; published: 2006-2014). Six studies were linked to published AS cohorts. In total, 966 men undergoing AS (mean: 102 per study) were assessed (mean age: 66 yr). AS patients had good overall HRQoL scores, which were comparable or better than those of patients undergoing postradical treatment (comparator group in four studies), men's partners (one study) and population-based data (three studies). Anxiety and depression scores were favourable. Selection bias may be present, as none were randomised comparisons. Decreased psychological well-being may be partly predicted by AS patients' baseline and clinical characteristics. Conclusions Patients undergoing AS reported good QoL and did not appear to suffer major negative psychological impacts. Longer follow-up is required as well as investigation into which patients are predisposed to negative impact and leaving AS prematurely. Patient summary We reviewed the published evidence for quality-of-life impact on men with prostate cancer being monitored by active surveillance. The men who were on active surveillance usually reported good levels of well-being and did not appear to suffer major negative psychological impacts. The research findings suggest little presence of anxiety and depression and high overall quality of life related to their disease. However, there are few long-term studies, so more high-quality research is needed to make definitive recommendations.},

abstract = {Background To reduce overdiagnosis and overtreatment, a test is urgently needed to detect clinically significant prostate cancer (PCa). Objective To develop a multimodal model, incorporating previously identified messenger RNA (mRNA) biomarkers and traditional risk factors that could be used to identify patients with high-grade PCa (Gleason score ≥7) on prostate biopsy. Design, setting, and participants In two prospective multicenter studies, urine was collected for mRNA profiling after digital rectal examination (DRE) and prior to prostate biopsy. The multimodal risk score was developed on a first cohort (n = 519) and subsequently validated clinically in an independent cohort (n = 386). Outcome measurements and statistical analysis The mRNA levels were measured using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Logistic regression was used to model patient risk and combine risk factors. Models were compared using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic, and clinical utility was evaluated with a decision curve analysis (DCA). Results and limitations HOXC6 and DLX1 mRNA levels were shown to be good predictors for the detection of high-grade PCa. The multimodal approach reached an overall AUC of 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85–0.95) in the validation cohort (AUC 0.86 in the training cohort), with the mRNA signature, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density, and previous cancer-negative prostate biopsies as the strongest, most significant components, in addition to nonsignificant model contributions of PSA, age, and family history. For another model, which included DRE as an additional risk factor, an AUC of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.80–0.92) was obtained (AUC 0.90 in the training cohort). Both models were successfully validated, with no significant change in AUC in the validation cohort, and DCA indicated a strong net benefit and the best reduction in unnecessary biopsies compared with other clinical decision-making tools, such as the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial risk calculator and the PCA3 assay. Conclusions The risk score based on the mRNA liquid biopsy assay combined with traditional clinical risk factors identified men at risk of harboring high-grade PCa and resulted in a better patient risk stratification compared with current methods in clinical practice. Therefore, the risk score could reduce the number of unnecessary prostate biopsies. Patient summary This study evaluated a novel urine-based assay that could be used as a noninvasive diagnostic aid for high-grade prostate cancer (PCa). When results of this assay are combined with traditional clinical risk factors, risk stratification for high-grade PCa and biopsy decision making are improved.},

The 4Kscore showed excellent calibration and demonstrated higher discrimination (AUC 0.82) and net benefit compared to a modified Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial Risk Calculator 2.0 model and standard of care (biopsy for all men) according to DCA. A possible reduction of 30-58% in the number biopsies was identified with delayed diagnosis in only 1.3-4.7% of Gleason ≥7 PCa cases, depending on the threshold used for biopsy. Pathological assessment was performed according to the standard of care at each site without centralized review. Conclusion The 4Kscore showed excellent diagnostic performance in detecting significant PCa. It is a useful tool in selecting men who have significant disease and are most likely to benefit from a prostate biopsy from men with no cancer or indolent cancer. Patient summary The 4Kscore provides each patient with an accurate and personalized measure of the risk of Gleason ≥7 cancer to aid in decision-making regarding the need for prostate biopsy.},

abstract = {Genome-wide DNA sequencing was used to decrypt the phylogeny of multiple samples from distinct areas of cancer and morphologically normal tissue taken from the prostates of three men. Mutations were present at high levels in morphologically normal tissue distant from the cancer, reflecting clonal expansions, and the underlying mutational processes at work in morphologically normal tissue were also at work in cancer. Our observations demonstrate the existence of ongoing abnormal mutational processes, consistent with field effects, underlying carcinogenesis. This mechanism gives rise to extensive branching evolution and cancer clone mixing, as exemplified by the coexistence of multiple cancer lineages harboring distinct ERG fusions within a single cancer nodule. Subsets of mutations were shared either by morphologically normal and malignant tissues or between different ERG lineages, indicating earlier or separate clonal cell expansions. Our observations inform on the origin of multifocal disease and have implications for prostate cancer therapy in individual cases.},

abstract = "Context
Prediction models are developed to aid health care providers in estimating the probability or risk that a specific disease or condition is present (diagnostic models) or that a specific event will occur in the future (prognostic models), to inform their decision making. However, the overwhelming evidence shows that the quality of reporting of prediction model studies is poor. Only with full and clear reporting of information on all aspects of a prediction model can risk of bias and potential usefulness of prediction models be adequately assessed.
Objective
The Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) Initiative developed a set of recommendations for the reporting of studies developing, validating, or updating a prediction model, whether for diagnostic or prognostic purposes.
Evidence acquisition
This article describes how the TRIPOD Statement was developed. An extensive list of items based on a review of the literature was created, which was reduced after a Web-based survey and revised during a 3-day meeting in June 2011 with methodologists, health care professionals, and journal editors. The list was refined during several meetings of the steering group and in e-mail discussions with the wider group of TRIPOD contributors.
Evidence synthesis
The resulting TRIPOD Statement is a checklist of 22 items, deemed essential for transparent reporting of a prediction model study. The TRIPOD Statement aims to improve the transparency of the reporting of a prediction model study regardless of the study methods used. The TRIPOD Statement is best used in conjunction with the TRIPOD explanation and elaboration document.
Conclusions
To aid the editorial process and readers of prediction model studies, it is recommended that authors include a completed checklist in their submission (also available at www.tripod-statement.org).

abstract = {Background: DD3PCA3is the most prostate cancer-specific gene described to date. To assess the clinical utility of DD3PCA3a time-resolved fluorescence-based, quantitative RT-PCR analysis for DD3PCA3was developed. Methods: The diagnostic potential of DD3PCA3was determined by quantitative measurement of DD3PCA3transcripts in non-malignant and malignant prostate specimens. Moreover, DD3PCA3transcripts were determined quantitatively in urine sediments obtained after prostatic massage. A cohort of 108 men, admitted for prostate biopsies based on a PSA of >3 ng/ml, was studied. Results: Prostate tumors showed a 66-fold up-regulation of DD3PCA3(median 158.4 {\textperiodcentered} 105copies/$\mu$g tissue RNA) when compared to benign prostate tissue (median 2.4 {\textperiodcentered} 105copies/$\mu$g tissue RNA). This up-regulation was found in more than 95% of prostate cancer specimens studied. These data revealed that specimens with less than 10% of cancer cells could be accurately discriminated from non-cancer tissues. Hence, detection of a small fraction of prostate cancer cells in a background of normal cells seemed feasible. Therefore, this DD3PCA3-based RT-PCR assay was used for the identification of prostate cancer in urine sediments obtained after prostatic massage. From 108 men with a serum PSA value >3 ng/ml, 24 men were shown to have prostate cancer upon biopsy. Of these 24 men, 16 were shown to be positive for DD3PCA3, indicating a sensitivity of the assay of 67%. Furthermore, a negative predictive value of 90% was calculated. Conclusion: The quantitative RT-PCR assay for DD3PCA3described, bears great promise as a tool for molecular urine analysis. It has great potential in reducing the number of unnecessary biopsies. A multi-center study using this DD3PCA3assay can provide the basis for the utility of molecular diagnostics in clinical urological practice. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Over the past decade, researchers have begun to unravel some of the genomic heterogeneity that contributes to these varying clinical phenotypes. Distinct molecular sub-classes of prostate cancer have been identified, and the uniqueness of these sub-classes has been leveraged to predict clinical outcomes, design novel biomarkers for prostate cancer diagnosis, and develop novel therapeutics. Recent work has also elucidated the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of prostate cancer, helping us understand disease pathogenesis, response to therapy, and progression. New genomic techniques have provided us with a window into the remarkable clinical and genomic heterogeneity of prostate cancer, and this new perspective will increasingly impact patient care.},

To achieve the best possible performance with a particular learning algorithm on a particular training set, a feature subset selection method should consider how the algorithm and the training set interact. We explore the relation between optimal feature subset selection and relevance. Our wrapper method searches for an optimal feature subset tailored to a particular algorithm and a domain. We study the strengths and weaknesses of the wrapper approach and show a series of improved designs. We compare the wrapper approach to induction without feature subset selection and to Relief, a filter approach to feature subset selection.

abstract = {Objectives: In 1998, D'Amico et al. suggested a model stratifying patients with prostate cancer into those with low, intermediate, or high-risk of biochemical recurrence after surgery according to the clinical TNM stage, biopsy Gleason score, and preoperative prostate-specific antigen level. We studied the performance and clinical relevance of this classification system over time, in the context of the stage migration seen in the contemporary era, using data from a high-volume, tertiary referral center. Method: From 1984 to 2005, 6652 men underwent radical prostatectomy at our institution for clinically localized prostate cancer (clinical Stage T1c-T2c) with follow-up information available and no neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy before biochemical recurrence. Biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the BRFS rates between the D'Amico risk groups and by era were compared using the log-rank statistic. Finally, the distribution of patients among the three groups was compared over time. Results: The 5-year BRFS rate was 84.6% overall and 94.5%, 76.6%, and 54.6% for the low, intermediate, and high-risk groups, respectively (P <0.0001). In the contemporary era, a very small fraction (4.9%) of patients undergoing radical prostatectomy at our institution were in the high-risk group, with most (67.7%) in the low-risk group (P <0.001). Conclusions: The D'Amico classification system continues to stratify men into risk groups with statistically significant differences in BRFS. However, the major shift in the distribution of patients among the three risk groups over time suggests that the clinical relevance of this classification scheme may be limited and diminishing in the contemporary era. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Background Urinary incontinence (UI) and erectile dysfunction (ED) remain the most common long-term complications of prostatectomy, with a significant impact on sexual health and quality of life. Aims To determine the relation between UI and moderate to severe ED and the risk factors for UI in patients undergoing robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. Methods Patients in our institutional database who underwent robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy for prostate cancer (2006–2013) and who completed the University of California–Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index and the Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) surveys at 12 months after prostatectomy were eligible for inclusion. Men who reported use of no urinary pads per day were considered continent, whereas men who used at least one pad per day were considered incontinent. Men with moderate to severe ED based on a SHIM score no higher than 11 were considered to have ED. Patients who had preoperative moderate to severe ED and/or UI based on these definitions were excluded from further analysis. Outcomes A better understanding of what increases the risk for UI after a prostatectomy and how it can co-occur with ED. Results We analyzed 464 patients who met the inclusion criteria. After prostatectomy, 36% of patients had UI and 47% of patients had moderate to severe ED. Of all patients with ED, 45% (98 of 216) were incontinent compared with 27% (67 of 248) of patients without ED (P <.001). On multivariable analysis, older age at diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] = 1.05, P =.002) and ED (OR = 1.88, P =.005) were independent predictors for incontinence. The use of unilateral nerve sparing (OR = 1.03, P =.94) or no nerve sparing (OR = 0.53, P =.50) during surgery did not have an impact on postoperative incontinence. Clinical Implications Understanding that ED is an independent predictor of UI after robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy has important clinical implications and suggests a common anatomic pathway. Strengths and Limitations Our focus on different measurements of incontinence and their relation to ED and our use of validated questionnaires to define incontinence and ED were important strengths of this study. Limitations of our study include its retrospective nature and the fact that our results were drawn from a single-center database of a tertiary referral hospital. Conclusion Our results show that the presence of moderate to severe ED after prostatectomy is an independent risk factor for incontinence, suggesting a possible common pathway for these two complications. Further studies to investigate the anatomic and clinical bases of this relation are warranted. Tsikis ST, Nottingham CU, Faris SF.

abstract = {Purpose: We compared pathological and biochemical outcomes after radical prostatectomy in patients at favorable intermediate risk who fulfilled current NCCN{\textregistered}(National Comprehensive Cancer Network{\textregistered}) Guidelines{\textregistered} for active surveillance criteria to outcomes in patients who met more traditional criteria for active surveillance. Materials and Methods: We queried our institutional review board approved prostate cancer database for patients who met NCCN criteria for very low risk (T1c, Grade Group 1, 3 or fewer of 12 cores, 50% or less core volume and prostate specific antigen density less than 0.15 ng/ml), low risk (T1-T2a, Grade Group 1 and prostate specific antigen less than 10 ng/ml) or favorable intermediate risk (major pattern grade 3 and less than 50% positive biopsy cores) and who had 1 intermediate risk factor, including T2b/c, Grade Group 2 or prostate specific antigen 10 to 20 ng/ml. Men at intermediate risk who did not meet favorable criteria were labeled as being at unfavorable intermediate risk. Patients at favorable intermediate risk were compared to those at very low and low risk, and those at unfavorable intermediate risk to identify differences in rates of adverse pathological findings at radical prostatectomy, including Gleason score Grade Group 3-5, nonorgan confined disease or nodal involvement. Time to biochemical recurrence was compared among the groups using Cox regression. Results: A total of 3,686 patients underwent radical prostatectomy between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2015. Of these men 1,454, 250 and 1,362 fulfilled the criteria for low, favorable intermediate and unfavorable intermediate risk, respectively. The rate of adverse pathological findings in favorable intermediate risk cases was significantly higher than in low risk cases and significantly lower than in unfavorable intermediate risk cases (27.4% vs 14.8% and 48.5%, respectively, each p <0.001). Time to biochemical recurrence differed significantly among the risk groups (p <0.001). Conclusions: Relative to men at low risk those at favorable intermediate risk represent a distinct group. Care should be taken when selecting these patients for active surveillance and monitoring them once they are in an active surveillance program.},

A statistical prediction model for prostate cancer has been developed, based on four Kallikrein markers in blood. This systematic review and meta-analysis examines the aggregated results from published studies of the Kallikrein Panel.\n\nMETHODS: Literature searches to identify relevant studies were conducted. A meta-analysis of the results was performed using inverse variance, mean difference with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). The results of the meta-analysis were used to assess the Kallikrein Panel's effect on healthcare costs.\n\nRESULTS: The Kallikrein Panel has been evaluated in more than 8,500 patients (2,780 with prostate cancer and 598 with high grade prostate cancer). Meta-analysis demonstrates a statistically significant improvement of 8-10% in predictive accuracy. In addition, 48% to 56% of current prostate biopsies could be avoided. Use of the Kallikrein Panel could result in annual US savings approaching $1 billion.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The Kallikrein Panel has the potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs. The panel provides significantly improved specificity. Because the Kallikrein Panel has been studied in a range of clinical settings, it is a test that could be readily and widely used in practice.},

abstract = {Background: Promoter and 5′ end methylation regulation of tumour suppressor genes is a common feature of many cancers. Such occurrences often lead to the silencing of these key genes and thus they may contribute to the development of cancer, including prostate cancer. Methodology/Principal Findings: In order to identify methylation changes in prostate cancer, we performed a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation using Agilent human CpG island arrays. Using computational and gene-specific validation approaches we have identified a large number of potential epigenetic biomarkers of prostate cancer. Further validation of candidate genes on a separate cohort of low and high grade prostate cancers by quantitative MethyLight analysis has allowed us to confirm DNA hypermethylation of HOXD3 and BMP7, two genes that may play a role in the development of high grade tumours. We also show that promoter hypermethylation is responsible for downregulated expression of these genes in the DU-145 PCa cell line. Conclusions/Significance: This study identifies novel epigenetic biomarkers of prostate cancer and prostate cancer progression, and provides a global assessment of DNA methylation in prostate cancer. {\textcopyright} 2008 Kron et al.},

abstract = {Purpose: This guideline is structured to provide a clinical framework stratified by cancer severity to facilitate care decisions and guide the specifics of implementing the selected management options. The summary presented represents Part I of the two-part series dedicated to Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer: AUA/ASTRO/SUO Guideline discussing risk stratification and care options by cancer severity. Materials and Methods: The systematic review utilized in the creation of this guideline was completed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and through additional supplementation by ECRI Institute. This review included articles published between January 2007 and March 2014 with an update search conducted through August 2016. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence for a particular treatment was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low) for support of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. Additional information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions ( in supplementary unabridged guideline, http://jurology.com/). Results: The AUA (American Urological Association), ASTRO, and SUO (Society of Urologic Oncology) formulated an evidence-based guideline based on a risk stratified clinical framework for the management of localized prostate cancer. Conclusions: This guideline attempts to improve a clinician's ability to treat patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer, but higher quality evidence in future trials will be essential to improve the level of care for these patients. In all cases, patient preferences should be considered when choosing a management strategy.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Gene expression analysis has identified several breast cancer subtypes, including basal-like, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 positive/estrogen receptor negative (HER2+/ER-), luminal A, and luminal B. OBJECTIVES: To determine population-based distributions and clinical associations for breast cancer subtypes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Immunohistochemical surrogates for each subtype were applied to 496 incident cases of invasive breast cancer from the Carolina Breast Cancer Study (ascertained between May 1993 and December 1996), a population-based, case-control study that oversampled premenopausal and African American women. Subtype definitions were as follows: luminal A (ER+ and/or progesterone receptor positive [PR+], HER2-), luminal B (ER+ and/or PR+, HER2+), basal-like (ER-, PR-, HER2-, cytokeratin 5/6 positive, and/or HER1+), HER2+/ER- (ER-, PR-, and HER2+), and unclassified (negative for all 5 markers). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We examined the prevalence of breast cancer subtypes within racial and menopausal subsets and determined their associations with tumor size, axillary nodal status, mitotic index, nuclear pleomorphism, combined grade, p53 mutation status, and breast cancer-specific survival. RESULTS: The basal-like breast cancer subtype was more prevalent among premenopausal African American women (39%) compared with postmenopausal African American women (14%) and non-African American women (16%) of any age (P<.001), whereas the luminal A subtype was less prevalent (36% vs 59% and 54%, respectively). The HER2+/ER- subtype did not vary with race or menopausal status (6%-9%). Compared with luminal A, basal-like tumors had more TP53 mutations (44% vs 15%, P<.001), higher mitotic index (odds ratio [OR], 11.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.6-21.7), more marked nuclear pleomorphism (OR, 9.7; 95% CI, 5.3-18.0), and higher combined grade (OR, 8.3; 95% CI, 4.4-15.6). Breast cancer-specific survival differed by subtype (P<.001), with shortest survival among HER2+/ER- and basal-like subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Basal-like breast tumors occurred at a higher prevalence among premenopausal African American patients compared with postmenopausal African American and non-African American patients in this population-based study. A higher prevalence of basal-like breast tumors and a lower prevalence of luminal A tumors could contribute to the poor prognosis of young African American women with breast cancer.},

abstract = {Prostate cancer remains one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancies worldwide. Early diagnosis and curative treatment seem to improve survival in men with unfavourable-risk cancers, but significant concerns exist regarding the overdiagnosis and overtreatment of men with lower-risk cancers. To this end, active surveillance (AS) has emerged as a primary management strategy in men with favourable-risk disease, and contemporary data suggest that use of AS has increased worldwide. Although published surveillance cohorts differ by protocol, reported rates of metastatic disease and prostate-cancer-specific mortality are exceedingly low in the intermediate term (5-10 years). Such outcomes seem to be closely associated with programme-specific criteria for selection, monitoring, and intervention, suggesting that AS - like other management strategies - could be individualized based on the level of risk acceptable to patients in light of their personal preferences. Additional data are needed to better establish the risks associated with AS and to identify patient-specific characteristics that could modify prognosis.},

abstract = {Purpose: The central zone of the prostate gland is a region rarely associated with carcinoma. To our knowledge central zone tumors have not previously been compared to carcinoma originating in the peripheral or transition zone of the prostate gland. Materials and Methods: All 2,010 radical prostatectomy cases seen at our institution from October 1998 to December 2006 were reviewed to identify tumor zonal origin. Central zone carcinoma was characterized and compared with tumors of other zones. Results: Zonal origin was determined in a total of 2,494 tumors in 1,703 cases. Of the tumors 63 (2.5%) were of central zone origin with 59 of the 63 representing the index or main tumor. Comparative analysis of a defined subset of 726 cases showed that central zone cancers were significantly more aggressive than peripheral or transition zone cancers with a far greater risk of extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion and positive surgical margins. Escape from the gland was often via the ejaculatory ducts and seminal vesicles. Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed that the probability of post-prostatectomy biochemical failure was double that of tumors of the other zones with a far more rapid rate of failure. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified Gleason grade, positive margins, extracapsular extension, tumor volume and preoperative serum prostate specific antigen as the major contributors to this poor prognosis, rather than specific zonal origin. Conclusions: To our knowledge this study provides the first characterization and comparative analysis of central zone carcinoma, identifying these tumors as a rare but highly aggressive form of prostate carcinoma with a distinct route of spread from the gland that contrasts with tumors of other zones. Preoperative identification is currently hampered by the avoidance of biopsy targeting the central zone. However, if recognized preoperatively, aggressive intervention may possibly improve the currently bleak outlook. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Urological Association.},

abstract = {Background Robust data on patient-reported outcome measures comparing treatments for clinically localized prostate cancer are lacking. We investigated the effects of active monitoring, radical prostatectomy, and radical radiotherapy with hormones on patient-reported outcomes. Methods We compared patient-reported outcomes among 1643 men in the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) trial who completed questionnaires before diagnosis, at 6 and 12 months after randomization, and annually thereafter. Patients completed validated measures that assessed urinary, bowel, and sexual function and specific effects on quality of life, anxiety and depression, and general health. Cancer-related quality of life was assessed at 5 years. Complete 6-year data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Results The rate of questionnaire completion during follow-up was higher than 85% for most measures. Of the three treatments, prostatectomy had the greatest negative effect on sexual function and urinary continence, and although there was some recovery, these outcomes remained worse in the prostatectomy group than in the other groups throughout the trial. The negative effect of radiotherapy on sexual function was greatest at 6 months, but sexual function then recovered somewhat and was stable thereafter; radiotherapy had little effect on urinary continence. Sexual and urinary function declined gradually in the active-monitoring group. Bowel function was worse in the radiotherapy group at 6 months than in the other groups but then recovered somewhat, except for the increasing frequency of bloody stools; bowel function was unchanged in the other groups. Urinary voiding and nocturia were worse in the radiotherapy group at 6 months but then mostly recovered and were similar to the other groups after 12 months. Effects on quality of life mirrored the reported changes in function. No significant differences were observed among the groups in measures of anxiety, depression, or general health-related or cancer-related quality of life. Conclusions In this analysis of patient-reported outcomes after treatment for localized prostate cancer, patterns of severity, recovery, and decline in urinary, bowel, and sexual function and associated quality of life differed among the three groups.

abstract = {Background: The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test is used to screen for prostate cancer but has a high false-positive rate that translates into unnecessary prostate biopsies and overdiagnosis of low-risk prostate cancers. We aimed to develop and validate a model to identify high-risk prostate cancer (with a Gleason score of at least 7) with better test characteristics than that provided by PSA screening alone. Methods: The Stockholm 3 (STHLM3) study is a prospective, population-based, paired, screen-positive, diagnostic study of men without prostate cancer aged 50-69 years randomly invited by date of birth from the Swedish Population Register kept by the Swedish Tax Agency. Men with prostate cancer at enrolment were excluded from the study. The predefined STHLM3 model (a combination of plasma protein biomarkers [PSA, free PSA, intact PSA, hK2, MSMB, MIC1], genetic polymorphisms [232 SNPs], and clinical variables [age, family, history, previous prostate biopsy, prostate exam]), and PSA concentration were both tested in all participants enrolled. The primary aim was to increase the specificity compared with PSA without decreasing the sensitivity to diagnose high-risk prostate cancer. The primary outcomes were number of detected high-risk cancers (sensitivity) and the number of performed prostate biopsies (specificity). The STHLM3 training cohort was used to train the STHLM3 model, which was prospectively tested in the STHLM3 validation cohort. Logistic regression was used to test for associations between biomarkers and clinical variables and prostate cancer with a Gleason score of at least 7. This study is registered with ISCRTN.com, number ISRCTN84445406. Findings: The STHLM3 model performed significantly better than PSA alone for detection of cancers with a Gleason score of at least 7 (p<0{\textperiodcentered}0001), the area under the curve was 0{\textperiodcentered}56 (95% CI 0{\textperiodcentered}55-0{\textperiodcentered}60) with PSA alone and 0{\textperiodcentered}74 (95% CI 0{\textperiodcentered}72-0{\textperiodcentered}75) with the STHLM3 model. All variables used in the STHLM3 model were significantly associated with prostate cancers with a Gleason score of at least 7 (p<0{\textperiodcentered}05) in a multiple logistic regression model. At the same level of sensitivity as the PSA test using a cutoff of ≥3 ng/mL to diagnose high risk prostate cancer, use of the STHLM3 model could reduce the number of biopsies by 32% (95% CI 24-39) and could avoid 44% (35-54) of benign biopsies. Interpretation: The STHLM3 model could reduce unnecessary biopsies without compromising the ability to diagnose prostate cancer with a Gleason score of at least 7, and could be a step towards personalised risk-based prostate cancer diagnostic programmes.

abstract = {An ensemble consists of a set of individually trained classifiers (such as neural networks or decision trees) whose predictions are combined when classifying novel instances. Pre-vious research has shown that an ensemble is often more accurate than any of the single classifiers in the ensemble. Bagging (Breiman, 1996c) and Boosting (Freund & Schapire, 1996; Schapire, 1990) are two relatively new but popular methods for producing ensem-bles. In this paper we evaluate these methods on 23 data sets using both neural networks and decision trees as our classification algorithm. Our results clearly indicate a number of conclusions. First, while Bagging is almost always more accurate than a single classifier, it is sometimes much less accurate than Boosting. On the other hand, Boosting can cre-ate ensembles that are less accurate than a single classifier – especially when using neural networks. Analysis indicates that the performance of the Boosting methods is dependent on the characteristics of the data set being examined. In fact, further results show that Boosting ensembles may overfit noisy data sets, thus decreasing its performance. Finally, consistent with previous studies, our work suggests that most of the gain in an ensemble's performance comes in the first few classifiers combined; however, relatively large gains can be seen up to 25 classifiers when Boosting decision trees.},

abstract = {Objective Active surveillance (AS) allows men with favorable‐risk prostate cancer to avoid or postpone active treatment and hence spares potential adverse effects for a significant proportion of these patients. Active surveillance may create an additional emotional burden for these patients. The aim of the review was to determine the psychological impact of AS to inform future study in this area and to provide recommendations for clinical practice. Methods Studies were identified through database searching from inception to September 2015. Quantitative or qualitative noninterventional studies published in English that assessed the psychological impact of AS were included. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to assess methodological quality. Results Twenty‐three papers were included (20 quantitative and 3 qualitative). Quantita-tively, the majority of patients do not report psychological difficulties; however, when appropri-ateness of study design is considered, the conclusion that AS has minimal impact on well‐being may not be accurate. This is due to small sample sizes, inappropriately timed baseline, and inap-propriate/lack of comparison groups. In addition, a mismatch in outcome was noted between the outcome of quantitative and qualitative studies in uncertainty, with qualitative studies indi-cating a greater psychological impact. Conclusions Because of methodological concerns, many quantitative studies may not provide a true account of the burden of AS. Further mixed‐methods studies are necessary to address the limitations highlighted and to provide clarity on the impact of AS. Practitioners should be aware that despite findings of previous reviews, patients may require additional emotional support. KEYWORDS active surveillance, anxiety, cancer, depression, oncology, prostatic neoplasms, uncertainty 1 | BACKGROUND Active surveillance (AS) was developed in response to the increasing prevalence of lower‐risk prostate cancer (PCa) in older men. 1 Active sur-veillance allows the majority of patients with lower‐risk PCa to avoid active treatment (AT) and hence the adverse effects associated with such therapy. 2 Although AS protocols may vary, they usually involve prostate‐specific antigen (PSA) tests and digital rectal examinations at regular intervals, and annual/biannual biopsies. In recent years, regular multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging scans of the prostate have become part of AS protocols. 3 Numerous studies have documented the appropriateness of AS from a medical perspective; however, the psy-chological impact of AS remains understudied. 4 Despite this, the assumption is that men undergoing AS do not require additional sup-port, psychological or otherwise, throughout this monitoring period. This assumption can partly be attributed to results of systematic reviews in this area; for example, a recent exclusively quantitative sys-tematic review 5 concluded that men on AS reported no major wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/pon 1 difficulties in quality of life (QoL) or psychological well‐being. However, this review used narrow inclusion and exclusion criteria and excluded studies referring to Watchful Waiting (WW), a management approach that is palliative in nature but often incorrectly used interchangeably with AS. This omission may have led to the exclusion of some relevant papers. The lack of critical appraisal meant study quality was not taken into consideration in the interpretation of the results. In a similar quantitative review, 6 it was concluded that AS was unlikely to be associated with an adverse effect on general psycholog-ical well‐being. In this instance, studies describing WW or " no treat-ment " were included. However, no distinction was made between those studies describing AS versus true WW. Although the methodo-logical quality of studies was assessed, this was not considered when interpreting the results of the review. In addition, neither of these reviews included qualitative studies, which meant that an important opportunity to better understand the experiences of patients was missed. It is our contention that a mixed‐methods (MM) review that includes both qualitative and quantitative studies would allow for richer experiential data to be included without compromising general-izability achieved using quantitative methods. 7 2 | AIMS The aim of this systematic mixed studies review was to synthesize and appraise the quantitative and qualitative knowledge to develop a more comprehensive picture of published studies reporting the psychologi-cal impact of undergoing AS. 3 | EVIDENCE ACQUISITION The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐ Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for the conduct and reporting of this systematic review. 8 3.1 | Eligibility criteria Inclusion criterion was noninterventional studies published in English assessing the psychological impact of AS in lower‐risk PCa, including studies comparing AS with AT. Studies referring to WW were included when the definition was that of AS. Exclusion criteria were review articles, editorials, comments, inter-vention studies (eg, studies that included a psychosocial intervention), needs assessments, and studies assessing QoL. While QoL is an impor-tant factor, it was deemed inappropriate for the present review because of the insensitivity of general QoL measures in assessing clin-ical change in psychological functioning. 9 3.2 | Information sources Medical and nursing databases were searched from inception between August and September 2015 with no limitations on time, using a predetermined search strategy (Figure 1). Titles and abstracts were screened by E.R. and G.P. based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria; where there was doubt regarding the eligibility of a particular title or abstract, the record was retained for full‐text screening. O.S. arbitrated any disagreement at the full‐text screening stage.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND It is unknown whether active surveillance can be safely offered to patients with Gleason 3+4 favorable intermediate-risk (FIR) prostate cancer. OBJECTIVE To examine the incidence and predictors of upgrading and upstaging among patients with Gleason 3+4 FIR disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The study involved 10 089 patients in the National Cancer Database diagnosed from 2010 to 2012 with Gleason 3+4 disease, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <10ng/ml, and cT1c-2a prostate cancer with <50% positive biopsy cores (PBCs) who underwent radical prostatectomy. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Logistic regression was used to examine predictors of upgrading (pathologic Gleason ≥4+3 or tertiary Gleason 5 in a Gleason 7 tumor) or upstaging (pT3–4/N1). RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Some 30.3% of Gleason 3+4 FIR patients were upgraded or upstaged. On multivariable analysis, predictors included higher PSA, percentage PBC, age, and cT2a versus cT1c (all p<0.001), but not black race (p=0.895). When stratified into ordinal variables, PSA 8.1–9.9 versus ≤4.0ng/ml (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.93, 38.3% vs 24.4%), PBC 37.5–49.9% versus <12.5% (AOR 1.79, 37.8% vs 25.1%); highest age quartile (≥67 yr) versus lowest (≤55 yr; AOR 1.46, 35.7% vs 24.7%); and cT2a versus cT1c (AOR 1.33, 34.3% vs 29.8%) were associated with a higher risk of upgrading or upstaging (all p<0.001). Men with PBC <12.5% and PSA ≤4.0ng/ml had a 21.7% risk of more advanced disease. This increased to 44.3% for PBC 37.5–49.9% and PSA 8.1–9.9ng/ml. A limitation of the study is its retrospective nature. CONCLUSIONS Approximately one in three patients with Gleason 3+4 FIR harbored disease of higher grade or stage. Younger patients with low percentage PBC and PSA and cT1c disease have a lower risk and may be candidates for active surveillance. However, widely available clinical information is insufficient for predicting the risk of more advanced disease, and the development and incorporation of additional tools, including magnetic resonance imaging and genomic tests, are necessary. PATIENT SUMMARY Nearly one-third of patients with Gleason 3+4 favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer harbor disease of higher grade or higher stage than their biopsy and clinical examination suggest. These patients would therefore be poor candidates for active surveillance.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIM To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of multiparametric magnetic imaging resonance (mpMRI) in men submitted to repeat saturation prostate biopsy (SPBx). MATERIALS AND METHODS From January 2011 to June 2017, 800 men underwent repeat SPBx; the cost-effectiveness of mpMRI if used as a 'triage test' to avoid unnecessary repeat prostate biopsy was retrospectively calculated using the Italian Public National Health System Day Service. RESULTS SPBx vs. MRI fusion targeted biopsy diagnosed 215 (89.5%) vs. 184 (76.6%) out of 240, respectively. The overall cost of the 800 prostate biopsies was 138,221 €; the use of mpMRI as triage test would have spared 364/800 procedures, equivalent to 60,905 € (44% of the entire cost), whilst missing 15/205 (7.3%) cases of clinically significant cancer. CONCLUSION mpMRI used as a triage test could reduce the need for prostate biopsies by about 45%, thereby improving cost-effectiveness, however, patients should be informed of the false-negative rate associated with mpMRI.},

abstract = {Background: Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) interpreted by experts is a powerful tool for diagnosing prostate cancer. However, the generalizability of published results across radiologists of varying expertise has not been verified. Objective: To assess variability in mpMRI reporting and diagnostic accuracy across radiologists of varying experience in routine clinical care. Design, setting, and participants: Men who underwent mpMRI and MR-fusion biopsy between 2014–2016. Each MRI scan was read by one of nine radiologists using the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PIRADS) and was not re-read before biopsy. Biopsy histopathology was the reference standard. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Outcomes were the PIRADS score distribution and diagnostic accuracy across nine radiologists. We evaluated the association between age, prostate-specific antigen, PIRADS score, and radiologist in predicting clinically significant cancer (Gleason ≥7) using multivariable logistic regression. We conducted sensitivity analyses for case volume and changes in accuracy over time. Results and limitations: We analyzed data for 409 subjects with 503 MRI lesions. While the number of lesions (mean 1.2 lesions/patient) did not differ across radiologists, substantial variation existed in PIRADS distribution and cancer yield. The significant cancer detection rate was 3–27% for PIRADS 3 lesions, 23–65% for PIRADS 4, and 40–80% for PIRADS 5 across radiologists. Some 13–60% of men with a PIRADS score of <3 on MRI harbored clinically significant cancer. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve varied from 0.69 to 0.81 for detection of clinically significant cancer. PIRADS score (p < 0.0001) and radiologist (p = 0.042) were independently associated with cancer in multivariable analysis. Neither individual radiologist volume nor study period impacted the results. MRI scans were not retrospectively re-read by all radiologists, precluding measurement of inter-observer agreement. Conclusions: We observed considerable variability in PIRADS score assignment and significant cancer yield across radiologists. We advise internal evaluation of mpMRI accuracy before widespread adoption. Patient summary: We evaluated the interpretation of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate in routine clinical care. Diagnostic accuracy depends on the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System score and the radiologist. In our study, the diagnostic accuracy of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) varied significantly across radiologists. We recommend internal evaluation of results before widespread adoption of MRI at individual medical centers.},

abstract = {Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is not a single disease, but several histologically defined cancers with different genetic drivers, clinical courses, and therapeutic responses. The current study evaluated 843 RCC from the three major histologic subtypes, including 488 clear cell RCC, 274 papillary RCC, and 81 chromophobe RCC. Comprehensive genomic and phenotypic analysis of the RCC subtypes reveals distinctive features of each subtype that provide the foundation for the development of subtype-specific therapeutic and management strategies for patients affected with these cancers. Somatic alteration of BAP1, PBRM1, and PTEN and altered metabolic pathways correlated with subtype-specific decreased survival, while CDKN2A alteration, increased DNA hypermethylation, and increases in the immune-related Th2 gene expression signature correlated with decreased survival within all major histologic subtypes. CIMP-RCC demonstrated an increased immune signature, and a uniform and distinct metabolic expression pattern identified a subset of metabolically divergent (MD) ChRCC that associated with extremely poor survival. Ricketts et al. find distinctive features of each RCC subtype, providing the foundation for development of subtype-specific therapeutic and management strategies. Somatic alteration of BAP1, PBRM1, and metabolic pathways correlates with subtype-specific decreased survival, while CDKN2A alteration, DNA hypermethylation, and Th2 immune signature correlate with decreased survival within all subtypes.},

abstract = {Controversy surrounds the use of PSA as a biomarker for prostate cancer detection, leaving an unmet need for a novel biomarker in this setting; urinary EN2 may identify individuals with clinically relevant prostate cancer. Male BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers are at increased risk of clinically significant prostate cancer and may benefit from screening. Urine samples from 413 BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers and controls were evaluated. Subjects underwent annual PSA screening with diagnostic biopsy triggered by PSA > 3.0 ng/ml; 21 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Urinary EN2 levels were measured by ELISA and had a sensitivity of 66.7% and specificity of 89.3% for cancer detection. There was no statistically significant difference in EN2 levels according to genetic status or Gleason score. Urinary EN2 may be useful as a non-invasive early biomarker for prostate cancer detection in genetically high-risk individuals.},

abstract = {Genetic profiling of urine cell free DNA (cfDNA) has not been evaluated in advanced prostate cancer. We performed whole genome sequencing of urine cfDNAs to identify tumor-associated copy number variations in urine before and after initiating androgen deprivation therapy in HSPC stage and docetaxel chemotherapy in CRPC stage. A log2 ratio-based copy number analysis de tected common genomic abnormalities in prostate cancer including AR amplification in 5/10 CRPC patients. Other abnormalities identified included TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, PTEN gene deletion, NOTCH1 locus amplification along with genomic amplifications at 8q24.3, 9q34.3, 11p15.5 and 14q11.2, and deletions at 4q35.2, 5q31.3, 7q36.3, 12q24.33, and 16p11.2. By comparing copy number between pre- and post-treatment, we found significant copy number changes in 34 genomic loci. To estimate the somatic tumor DNA fraction in urine cfDNAs, we developed a Urine Genomic Abnormality (UGA) score algorithm that summed the top ten most significant segments with copy number changes. The UGA scores correlated with tumor burden and the change in UGA score after stage-specific therapies reflected disease progression status and overall survival. The study demonstrates the potential clinical utility of urine cfDNAs in predicting treatment response and monitoring disease progression.},

The model we study can be interpreted as a broad, abstract extension of the well-studied on-line prediction model to a general decision-theoretic setting. We show that the multiplicative weight-update Littlestone-Warmuth rule can be adapted to this model, yielding bounds that are slightly weaker in some cases, but applicable to a considerably more general class of learning problems. We show how the resulting learning algorithm can be applied to a variety of problems, including gambling, multiple-outcome prediction, repeated games, and prediction of points in ℝn. In the second part of the paper we apply the multiplicative weight-update technique to derive a new boosting algorithm. This boosting algorithm does not require any prior knowledge about the performance of the weak learning algorithm. We also study generalizations of the new boosting algorithm to the problem of learning functions whose range, rather than being binary, is an arbitrary finite set or a bounded segment of the real line. {\textcopyright} 1997 Academic Press.},

In the current study, we show that great diversity exists in the precise structure of TMPRSS2-ERG hybrid transcripts found in human prostates. Fourteen distinct hybrid transcripts are characterized, each containing different combinations of sequences from the TMPRSS2 and ERG genes. The transcripts include two that are predicted to encode a normal full-length ERG protein, six that encode N-terminal truncated ERG proteins and one that encodes a TMPRSS2-ERG fusion protein. Interestingly, distinct patterns of hybrid transcripts were found in samples taken from separate regions of individual cancer-containing prostates, suggesting that TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusions may be arising independently in different regions of a single prostate.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prevention of unnecessary biopsies and overtreatment of indolent disease remains a challenge in the management of prostate cancer. Novel non-invasive tests that can identify clinically significant (intermediate-risk and high-risk) diseases are needed to improve risk stratification and monitoring of prostate cancer patients. Here, we investigated a panel of six DNA methylation biomarkers in urine samples collected post-digital rectal exam from patients undergoing prostate biopsy, for their utility to guide decision making for diagnostic biopsy and early detection of aggressive prostate cancer. RESULTS: We recruited 408 patients in risk categories ranging from benign to low-, intermediate-, and high-risk prostate cancer from three international cohorts. Patients were separated into 2/3 training and 1/3 validation cohorts. Methylation biomarkers were analyzed in post-digital rectal exam urinary sediment DNA by quantitative MethyLight assay and investigated for their association with any or aggressive prostate cancers. We developed a Prostate Cancer Urinary Epigenetic (ProCUrE) assay based on an optimal two-gene (HOXD3 and GSTP1) LASSO model, derived from methylation values in the training cohort, and assessed ProCUrE's diagnostic and prognostic ability for prostate cancer in both the training and validation cohorts. ProCUrE demonstrated improved prostate cancer diagnosis and identification of patients with clinically significant disease in both the training and validation cohorts. Using three different risk stratification criteria (Gleason score, D'Amico criteria, and CAPRA score), we found that the positive predictive value for ProCUrE was higher (59.4-78%) than prostate specific antigen (PSA) (38.2-72.1%) for all risk category comparisons. ProCUrE also demonstrated additive value to PSA in identifying GS >/= 7 PCa compared to PSA alone (DeLong's test p = 0.039), as well as additive value to the PCPT risk calculator for identifying any PCa and GS >/= 7 PCa (DeLong's test p = 0.011 and 0.022, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: ProCUrE is a promising non-invasive urinary methylation assay for the early detection and prognostication of prostate cancer. ProCUrE has the potential to supplement PSA testing to identify patients with clinically significant prostate cancer.},

abstract = {Background Early screening for prostate cancer (PCA) remains controversial because of overdiagnosis and overtreatment of clinically insignificant cancers. Even though a number of diagnostic tests have been developed to improve on PSA testing, there remains a need for a more informative non-invasive test for PCA. The objective of this study is to identify a panel of DNA methylation markers suitable for a non-invasive diagnostic test from urine DNA collected following a digital rectal exam (DRE) and/or from first morning void (FV). A secondary objective is to determine if the cumulative methylation is indicative of biopsy findings. Methods DRE and FV urine samples were prospectively collected from 94 patients and analyzed using 24 methylation-specific quantitative PCR assays derived from 19 CpG islands. The methylation of individual markers and various combinations of markers was compared to biopsy results. A methylation threshold for cancer classification was determined using a target specificity of 70%. The average methylation and the number of positive markers were also compared to the result of the biopsy, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were calculated. Results Methylation of all 19 markers was detected in FV and DRE DNAs. Combining the methylation of two or more markers improved on individual marker results. Using 6of19 methylated markers as the threshold for cancer classification yielded a specificity of 71% (95% CI, 0.57-0.86) from both DRE and FV and a sensitivity of 89% (95% CI, 0.79-0.97) from DRE and 94% (95% CI, 0.84-1.0) from FV. The negative predictive value at the 6of19 threshold was ≥ 90 for both DNA types. Conclusions PCA-specific methylation was detected in both FV and DRE DNA. There was no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy at the 6of19 threshold between DRE and FV urine DNA. The results support the development of a non-invasive diagnostic test to reduce unnecessary biopsies in men with elevated PSA. The test can also provide patients with personalized recommendations based on their own methylation profile.},

abstract = {Purpose: We compared pathological and biochemical outcomes after radical prostatectomy in patients at favorable intermediate risk who fulfilled current NCCN{\textregistered}(National Comprehensive Cancer Network{\textregistered}) Guidelines{\textregistered} for active surveillance criteria to outcomes in patients who met more traditional criteria for active surveillance. Materials and Methods: We queried our institutional review board approved prostate cancer database for patients who met NCCN criteria for very low risk (T1c, Grade Group 1, 3 or fewer of 12 cores, 50% or less core volume and prostate specific antigen density less than 0.15 ng/ml), low risk (T1-T2a, Grade Group 1 and prostate specific antigen less than 10 ng/ml) or favorable intermediate risk (major pattern grade 3 and less than 50% positive biopsy cores) and who had 1 intermediate risk factor, including T2b/c, Grade Group 2 or prostate specific antigen 10 to 20 ng/ml. Men at intermediate risk who did not meet favorable criteria were labeled as being at unfavorable intermediate risk. Patients at favorable intermediate risk were compared to those at very low and low risk, and those at unfavorable intermediate risk to identify differences in rates of adverse pathological findings at radical prostatectomy, including Gleason score Grade Group 3-5, nonorgan confined disease or nodal involvement. Time to biochemical recurrence was compared among the groups using Cox regression. Results: A total of 3,686 patients underwent radical prostatectomy between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2015. Of these men 1,454, 250 and 1,362 fulfilled the criteria for low, favorable intermediate and unfavorable intermediate risk, respectively. The rate of adverse pathological findings in favorable intermediate risk cases was significantly higher than in low risk cases and significantly lower than in unfavorable intermediate risk cases (27.4% vs 14.8% and 48.5%, respectively, each p <0.001). Time to biochemical recurrence differed significantly among the risk groups (p <0.001). Conclusions: Relative to men at low risk those at favorable intermediate risk represent a distinct group. Care should be taken when selecting these patients for active surveillance and monitoring them once they are in an active surveillance program.},

Herein, we investigate tumor-derived exosomes involved in normal immunological communications as means of inhibiting an antitumor T-cell response. Exosomes derived from LNCaP, a human prostate cancer cell line, were visualized by FACS and identified based on size (80-200 nm) in comparison to marker beads. Exosomes from tumor cell line inhibited T-cell proliferation. Dose-dependent apoptosis of T cells was induced by co-culture with tumor exosomes. Addition of anti-FasL antibody blocked the apoptosis induction by tumor exosomes.

abstract = {Convolutional neural networks are rapidly gaining popularity in regulatory genomics. Typically, these networks have a stack of convolutional and pooling layers, followed by one or more fully connected layers. In genomics, the same positional patterns are often present across multiple convolutional channels. Therefore, in current state-of-the-art networks, there exists significant redundancy in the representations learned by standard fully connected layers. We present a new separable fully connected layer that learns a weights tensor that is the outer product of positional weights and cross-channel weights, thereby allowing the same positional patterns to be applied across multiple convolutional channels. Decomposing positional and cross-channel weights further enables us to readily impose biologically-inspired constraints on positional weights, such as symmetry. We also propose a novel regularizer and constraint that act on curvature in the positional weights. Using experiments on simulated and in vivo datasets, we show that networks that incorporate our separable fully connected layer outperform conventional models with analogous architectures and the same number of parameters. Additionally, our networks are more robust to hyperparameter tuning, have more informative gradients, and produce importance scores that are more consistent with known biology than conventional deep neural networks.

abstract = {Background: A critical problem in the clinical management of prostate cancer is that it is highly heterogeneous. Accurate prediction of individual cancer behaviour is therefore not achievable at the time of diagnosis leading to substantial overtreatment. It remains an enigma that, in contrast to breast cancer, unsupervised analyses of global expression profiles have not currently defined robust categories of prostate cancer with distinct clinical outcomes. Objective: To devise a novel classification framework for human prostate cancer based on unsupervised mathematical approaches. Design, setting, and participants: Our analyses are based on the hypothesis that previous attempts to classify prostate cancer have been unsuccessful because individual samples of prostate cancer frequently have heterogeneous compositions. To address this issue, we applied an unsupervised Bayesian procedure called Latent Process Decomposition to four independent prostate cancer transcriptome datasets obtained using samples from prostatectomy patients and containing between 78 and 182 participants. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Biochemical failure was assessed using log-rank analysis and Cox regression analysis. Results and limitations: Application of Latent Process Decomposition identified a common process in all four independent datasets examined. Cancers assigned to this process (designated DESNT cancers) are characterized by low expression of a core set of 45 genes, many encoding proteins involved in the cytoskeleton machinery, ion transport, and cell adhesion. For the three datasets with linked prostate-specific antigen failure data following prostatectomy, patients with DESNT cancer exhibited poor outcome relative to other patients (p =2.65×10-5, p =4.28×10-5, and p =2.98×10-8). When these three datasets were combined the independent predictive value of DESNT membership was p =1.61×10-7compared with p =1.00×10-5for Gleason sum. A limitation of the study is that only prediction of prostate-specific antigen failure was examined. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the existence of a novel poor prognosis category of human prostate cancer and will assist in the targeting of therapy, helping avoid treatment-associated morbidity in men with indolent disease. Patient summary: Prostate cancer, unlike breast cancer, does not have a robust classification framework. We propose that this failure has occurred because prostate cancer samples selected for analysis frequently have heterozygous compositions (individual samples are made up of many different parts that each have different characteristics). Applying a mathematical approach that can overcome this problem we identify a novel poor prognosis category of human prostate cancer called DESNT. The study identifies a novel poor prognostic category of human prostate cancer designed DESNT.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is widely used to detect prostate cancer. The low positive predictive value of elevated PSA results in large numbers of unnecessary prostate biopsies. We set out to determine whether a multivariable model including four kallikrein forms (total, free, and intact PSA, and human kallikrein 2 (hK2)) could predict prostate biopsy outcome in previously unscreened men with elevated total PSA.\n\nMETHODS: The study cohort comprised 740 men in G{\"{o}}teborg, Sweden, undergoing biopsy during the first round of the European Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer. We calculated the area-under-the-curve (AUC) for predicting prostate cancer at biopsy. AUCs for a model including age and PSA (the 'laboratory' model) and age, PSA and digital rectal exam (the 'clinical' model) were compared with those for models that also included additional kallikreins.\n\nRESULTS: Addition of free and intact PSA and hK2 improved AUC from 0.68 to 0.83 and from 0.72 to 0.84, for the laboratory and clinical models respectively. Using a 20% risk of prostate cancer as the threshold for biopsy would have reduced the number of biopsies by 424 (57%) and missed only 31 out of 152 low-grade and 3 out of 40 high-grade cancers.\n\nCONCLUSION: Multiple kallikrein forms measured in blood can predict the result of biopsy in previously unscreened men with elevated PSA. A multivariable model can determine which men should be advised to undergo biopsy and which might be advised to continue screening, but defer biopsy until there was stronger evidence of malignancy.},

These vesicles are present in nearly all human body fluids, including blood plasma/serum, saliva, breast milk, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, semen, and particularly enriched in tumor microenvironment. Exosomes contain multiple proteins, DNA, mRNA, miRNA, long non-coding RNA, and even genetic materials of viruses/prions. These materials are biochemically and functionally distinct and can be transferred to a recipient cell where they regulate protein expression and signaling pathways. Recently, exosomes are demonstrated to have a close relationship with tumor development and metastasis. Exosomes influence therapeutic effect in cancer patients. In this review, we describe the biogenesis, composition, and function of exosomes. The mechanism on how tumor-derived exosomes contribute to cancer progression and clinical treatment failure is also described, with special focus on their potential applications in cancer therapy.},

abstract = {We performed a systematic literature search to identify original articles and editorials about the Decipher({\textregistered}) Prostate Cancer Test (GenomeDx Biosciences, San Diego, CA) to provide an overview of the current literature and its present role in urologic clinical practice. The Decipher test, which uses the expression of 22 selected RNA markers (from a total of over 1.4 million), showed a very high discrimination in predicting clinical metastasis (0.75-0.83) and cancer-specific mortality (0.78) in external validation studies, outperforming all routinely available clinicopathologic characteristics. Further, the timing of postoperative radiotherapy (adjuvant vs salvage) may be guided based on Decipher scores. The Decipher test was also the only independent predictor of clinical metastasis in patients with biochemical recurrence after surgery. The Decipher Genomic Resource Information Database (GRID) is a novel research tool that captures 1.4 million marker expressions per patient and may facilitate precision-guided, individualized care to patients with prostate cancer. In this era of precision medicine, Decipher, along with the Decipher GRID platform, is a promising genomic tool that may aid in managing prostate cancer patients throughout the continuum of care and delivering appropriate treatment at an individualized level.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare pathological and biochemical outcomes of radical prostatectomy (RP) among African-American (AA), Afro-Caribbean (AC; Jamaican) and Caucasian-American (CA) men using an international cohort of patients who underwent RP in the USA and Jamaica.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of men who underwent RP for clinically organ-confined (OC) prostate cancer between 2000 and 2011 at Columbia University Medical Center (New York, USA) and the University Hospital of the West Indies (Kingston, Jamaica) between 2000 and 2007. Men who had received neoadjuvant or adjuvant (within 3 months) therapy were excluded. Clinicopathological variables were compared among the three groups, focusing on age, stage, PSA level, Gleason sum (GS) and margin status. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the predictors of biochemical recurrence (BCR; PSA >0.2 ng/mL), and Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to determine BCR-free survival rates in AA, AC and CA men.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 483 men underwent RP for clinically OC disease (CM, n = 309, AA, n = 93 and AC, n = 81). The mean patient age was 59 years, with AA men being younger than CA men (58 vs 60 years, P< 0.05). The mean (range) follow-up was 49 (13-133) months with no significant difference among the groups. The men in the AC cohort had a higher mean PSA level than AA and CA men (8.8 vs 6.2 and 5.0 ng/mL, respectively, P< 0.05) and more clinical GS ≥7 (44%) tumours than AA (8%) and CA men (0%; P< 0.01). On multivariate analysis, controlling for stage, grade, PSA level and margins, AA and AC race were independent predictors of BCR. AA and AC men had significantly lower 5-year BCR-free survival (76 and 74%, respectively) than CA men (98% [P < 0.001]).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This international comparison of clinicopathological outcomes in AA, AC and CA men undergoing RP shows that AA and AC men present similarly with more aggressive disease features than CA men and have lower 5-year BCR-free survival. Both AA and AC race are significant predictors of BCR, independently of stage, grade, PSA level and margin status. Further research is needed to elucidate and correct the mechanisms behind the observed difference in outcome among these populations.},

abstract = {Localized prostate cancer (PCa) is a clinically heterogeneous disease, which presents with variability in patient outcomes within the same risk stratification (low, intermediate or high) and even within the same Gleason scores. Genomic tools have been developed with the purpose of stratifying patients affected by this disease to help physicians personalize therapies and follow-up schemes. This review focuses on these tissue-based tools. At present, four genomic tools are commercially available: Decipher™, Oncotype DX{\textregistered}, Prolaris{\textregistered} and ProMark{\textregistered}. Decipher™ is a tool based on 22 genes and evaluates the risk of adverse outcomes (metastasis) after radical prostatectomy (RP). Oncotype DX{\textregistered} is based on 17 genes and focuses on the ability to predict outcomes (adverse pathology) in very low-low and low-intermediate PCa patients, while Prolaris{\textregistered} is built on a panel of 46 genes and is validated to evaluate outcomes for patients at low risk as well as patients who are affected by high risk PCa and post-RP. Finally, ProMark{\textregistered} is based on a multiplexed proteomics assay and predicts PCa aggressiveness in patients found with similar features to Oncotype DX{\textregistered}. These biomarkers can be helpful for post-biopsy decision-making in low risk patients and post-radical prostatectomy in selected risk groups. Further studies are needed to investigate the clinical benefit of these new technologies, the financial ramifications and how they should be utilized in clinics.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The Oncotype DX Prostate Cancer Assay is a multi-gene RT-PCR expression assay that was developed for use with fixed paraffin-embedded (FPE) diagnostic prostate needle biopsies containing as little as 1 mm of prostate tumor in the greatest dimension. The assay measures expression of 12 cancer-related genes representing four biological pathways and 5 reference genes which are algorithmically combined to calculate the Genomic Prostate Score (GPS). This biopsy-based assay has been analytically and subsequently clinically validated as a predictor of aggressive prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to validate the analytical performance of the Oncotype DX Prostate Cancer Assay using predefined acceptance criteria. RESULTS The lowest quartile of RNA yields from prostate needle biopsies (six 5 $\mu$m sections) was between 19 and 34 ng. Analytical validation of the process requiring as little as 5 ng of RNA met all pre-defined acceptance criteria. Amplification efficiencies, analytical sensitivity, and accuracy of gene assays were measured by serially diluting an RNA sample and analyzing features of the linear regression between RNA expression measured by the crossing point (Cp) versus the log2 of the RNA input per PCR assay well. Gene assays were shown to accurately measure expression over a wide range of inputs (from as low as 0.005 ng to 320 ng). Analytical accuracy was excellent with average biases at qPCR inputs representative of patient samples <9.7% across all assays while amplification efficiencies were within ±6% of the median. Assessments of reproducibility and precision were performed by testing 10 prostate cancer RNA samples over multiple instruments, reagent lots, operators, days (precision), and RNA input levels (reproducibility) using appropriately parameterized linear mixed models. The standard deviations for analytical precision and reproducibility were 1.86 and 2.11 GPS units (100-unit scale) respectively. CONCLUSIONS The Oncotype DX Prostate Cancer Assay, a clinical RT-PCR assay specifically designed for use with prostate needle biopsies, has been analytically validated using very limited RNA inputs. The assay requirements and analytical performance will provide physicians with test results from a robust and reliable assay which will enable improved treatment decisions for men diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer.},

@article{McNeal1969,
abstract = {Detailed histologic study of 45 cancerous prostate glands in 134 autopsies provided new information on the natural history of prostatic carcinoma. Origin of carcinoma was limited to one of two histologically distinct regions, but with no apparent predilection for the “posterior lobe” or sub capsular area. Carcinoma selectively originated from active gland epithelium rather than a trophic glands, and distinctive premalignant changes accompanied its origin. Evidence from volume distribution data suggests that there are not two types of prostatic carcinoma with different biologic potential, but a single species having slow growth rate with a logarithmic growth curve. The development of carcinoma in the gland follows predictable patterns, including early involvement of the capsule and perineural spaces. The later course of tumor growth is characterized by loss of differentiation and the ability to penetrate the capsule and periurethral stroma. This suggests a gradual increase in biologic malignant potential which is closely linked to tumor size. Probably the capacity for distant metastasis is almost limited to large carcinomas, and penetration of the gland capsule may be the most important predisposing factor.},

@article{Gardiner2016,
abstract = {Accurate identification of patients with early prostate cancer warranting treatment with curative intent remains problematic, with various approaches proposed to detect the presence of high-risk disease. In this issue of European Urology, Van Neste et al [1] report findings for an approach in which two mRNA markers, homeobox genes HOXC6 and DLX1, are combined with traditional clinical risk factors used in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PRCPT) risk calculator. This group previously identified these genes and used them with TDRD1 in a urinary three-gene panel that had higher accuracy than PCA3 or serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) [2] in predicting prostate cancer (Gleason score [ 2 _ T D $ D I F F ] 7). Two sequential multicentre clinical trials undertaken from 2009 to 2014 in The Netherlands included 519 men in a training cohort and 386 in a validation cohort. Expression levels of HOXC6 and DLX1 mRNA combined with serum PSA, PSA density, digital rectal examination (DRE), age, and family history yielded an overall area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85–0.95) for the validation cohort (AUC 0.86 for the training cohort). The authors determined that serum PSA, family history, and age were no longer significant predictors when HOXC6 and DLX1 were included. Interestingly, addition of the commercial Progensa PCA3 previously promoted by this group did not improve predictability. The authors are to be congratulated for their approach in developing a well-established calculator by incorporating molecular profiling in a clinician-friendly manner for potential routine use. Because of the very promising findings reported here, it is expected that these markers are likely to herald the integration of others into calculator programmes, with subjective and imprecise parameters progressively replaced by more reliable molecular signa-tures. However, some caution should be exercised before applying the outcomes from this study to routine [ 3 _ T D $ D I F F ] triaging of men for biopsies in clinical practice. Apart from the need to validate such findings in different populations, several aspects of this report require consid-eration. First, a standardised approach for milking prostatic fluid consisting of three strokes per lobe [3] was used along with transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy in which a median of ten cores were taken. This is very likely to have undersampled prostate glands in this population of men, whose TRUS-estimated prostatic [ 4 _ T D $ D I F F ] volumes had large median values of 48 cm 3 [ 1 _ T D $ D I F F ] (35–67) and 45 cm 3 (35–62) in the two cohorts [1]. Thus, the parts of the prostate milked corresponded to the parts biopsied because, as the authors acknowledge, TRUS-guided transrectal biopsies tend to miss a significant percentage of cancers, particularly those sited anteriorly, especially in larger prostate glands. The authors also concede that the fidelity of their findings may have been affected by a lack of centralised pathology, but do not mention a reason for choosing the PRCPT calculator over others, in particular the European Randomised Study for Screening of Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) calculator. They previously used the ERSPC calculator in a training and validation study together with PCA3 and TMPRSS2-ERG, which gave an AUC of 0.842 [4]. They found that[ 5 _ T D $ D I F F ] , unlike PCA3, TMPRSS2-ERG had prognostic value[ 6 _ T D $ D I F F ] and that, when combined with PCA3,[ 7 _ T D $ D I F F ] TMPRSS2-ERG was likely to lead to a reduction in prostate biopsies. Tomlins et al [5] used logistic regression},

In the present study, we investigated the cardiovascular and pulmonary health effects of 10 weeks of repeated oral or pulmonary exposures to MWCNTs (4 or 40 $\mu$g each week) in Apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE−/−) mice fed a Western-type diet. Intratracheal instillation of MWCNTs was associated with oxidative damage to DNA in lung tissue and elevated levels of lipid peroxidation products in plasma, whereas the exposure only caused a modest pulmonary inflammation in terms of increased numbers of lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Ultrasound imaging in live animals revealed an increase in the inner and outer wall thickness of the aortic arch at 10 weeks after pulmonary exposure to MWCNTs, which may suggest artery remodelling. However, we did not find accelerated plaque progression in the aorta or the brachiocephalic artery by histopathology. Furthermore, repeated oral exposure to MWCNTs did not cause changes in the composition of gut microbiota of exposed mice. Collectively, this study indicates that repeated pulmonary exposure to MWCNTs was associated with oxidative stress, whereas cardiovascular effects encompassed remodelling of the aorta wall.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To analyze the impact of season and weather parameters on serum PSA values in men without prostate cancer. METHODS: Retrospective study including medical records from the Spanish arm of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC). Exclusion criteria: prostate cancer diagnosis, PSA > = 10 ng/ml, or PSA > = 3 ng/ml and/or digital rectal examination abnormalities unless a negative prostate biopsy was provided. Univariate relationships between PSA value, season and several weather parameters were assessed. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify independent predictors of a PSA value > = 3 ng/ml. RESULTS: A total of 2,147 men entered into the study. Median age and PSA level were 57 years and 0.9 ng/ml respectively. A non-significant trend to higher PSA levels was observed during autumn and winter. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified only maximum temperature (p < 0.001), minimum temperature (p = 0.001) and age (p < 0.001) as independent predictors of a PSA value > = 3 ng/ml. Mean age-adjusted PSA levels at maximum temperatures of < = 15 degrees C, 16-20 degrees C, 21-25 degrees C and > =26 degrees C were 1.25, 1.20, 1.17 and 1.09 ng/ml respectively. CONCLUSIONS: PSA levels are slightly higher during cold weather conditions. Because of the small magnitude of this PSA increment we do not recommend to change biopsy indication based solely on climatic parameters},

abstract = {Importance Prostate cancer screening remains controversial because potential mortality or quality-of-life benefits may be outweighed by harms from overdetection and overtreatment. Objective To evaluate the effect of a single prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening intervention and standardized diagnostic pathway on prostate cancer–specific mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants The Cluster Randomized Trial of PSA Testing for Prostate Cancer (CAP) included 419 582 men aged 50 to 69 years and was conducted at 573 primary care practices across the United Kingdom. Randomization and recruitment of the practices occurred between 2001 and 2009; patient follow-up ended on March 31, 2016. Intervention An invitation to attend a PSA testing clinic and receive a single PSA test vs standard (unscreened) practice. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcome: prostate cancer–specific mortality at a median follow-up of 10 years. Prespecified secondary outcomes: diagnostic cancer stage and Gleason grade (range, 2-10; higher scores indicate a poorer prognosis) of prostate cancers identified, all-cause mortality, and an instrumental variable analysis estimating the causal effect of attending the PSA screening clinic. Results Among 415 357 randomized men (mean [SD] age, 59.0 [5.6] years), 189 386 in the intervention group and 219 439 in the control group were included in the analysis (n = 408 825; 98%). In the intervention group, 75 707 (40%) attended the PSA testing clinic and 67 313 (36%) underwent PSA testing. Of 64 436 with a valid PSA test result, 6857 (11%) had a PSA level between 3 ng/mL and 19.9 ng/mL, of whom 5850 (85%) had a prostate biopsy. After a median follow-up of 10 years, 549 (0.30 per 1000 person-years) died of prostate cancer in the intervention group vs 647 (0.31 per 1000 person-years) in the control group (rate difference, −0.013 per 1000 person-years [95% CI, −0.047 to 0.022]; rate ratio [RR], 0.96 [95% CI, 0.85 to 1.08];P = .50). The number diagnosed with prostate cancer was higher in the intervention group (n = 8054; 4.3%) than in the control group (n = 7853; 3.6%) (RR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.14 to 1.25];P < .001). More prostate cancer tumors with a Gleason grade of 6 or lower were identified in the intervention group (n = 3263/189 386 [1.7%]) than in the control group (n = 2440/219 439 [1.1%]) (difference per 1000 men, 6.11 [95% CI, 5.38 to 6.84];P < .001). In the analysis of all-cause mortality, there were 25 459 deaths in the intervention group vs 28 306 deaths in the control group (RR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.94 to 1.03];P = .49). In the instrumental variable analysis for prostate cancer mortality, the adherence-adjusted causal RR was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.67 to 1.29;P = .66). Conclusions and Relevance Among practices randomized to a single PSA screening intervention vs standard practice without screening, there was no significant difference in prostate cancer mortality after a median follow-up of 10 years but the detection of low-risk prostate cancer cases increased. Although longer-term follow-up is under way, the findings do not support single PSA testing for population-based screening. Trial Registration ISRCTN Identifier:ISRCTN92187251},

abstract = {Background and Objective: Cancer is a complex worldwide health problem associated with high mortality. With the rapid development of the high-throughput sequencing technology and the application of various machine learning methods that have emerged in recent years, progress in cancer prediction has been increasingly made based on gene expression, providing insight into effective and accurate treatment decision making. Thus, developing machine learning methods, which can successfully distinguish cancer patients from healthy persons, is of great current interest. However, among the classification methods applied to cancer prediction so far, no one method outperforms all the others. Methods: In this paper, we demonstrate a new strategy, which applies deep learning to an ensemble approach that incorporates multiple different machine learning models. We supply informative gene data selected by differential gene expression analysis to five different classification models. Then, a deep learning method is employed to ensemble the outputs of the five classifiers. Results: The proposed deep learning-based multi-model ensemble method was tested on three public RNA-seq data sets of three kinds of cancers, Lung Adenocarcinoma, Stomach Adenocarcinoma and Breast Invasive Carcinoma. The test results indicate that it increases the prediction accuracy of cancer for all the tested RNA-seq data sets as compared to using a single classifier or the majority voting algorithm. Conclusions: By taking full advantage of different classifiers, the proposed deep learning-based multi-model ensemble method is shown to be accurate and effective for cancer prediction.},

@article{Hastie2003,
abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting--the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, and projection pursuit. FROM THE REVIEWS: TECHNOMETRICS "[This] is a vast and complex book. Generally, it concentrates on explaining why and how the methods work, rather than how to use them. Examples and especially the visualizations are principle features...As a source for the methods of statistical learning...it will probably be a long time before there is a competitor to this book."},

abstract = {Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the Western male population. Despite the tremendous efforts that have been made to improve the early detection of this disease and to design new treatment modalities, there is still an urgent need for new markers and therapeutic targets for the management of prostate cancer patients. Using differential display analysis to compare the mRNA expression patterns of normal versus tumor tissue of the human prostate, we identified a cDNA, DD3, which is highly overexpressed in 53 of 56 prostatic tumors in comparison to nonneoplastic prostatic tissue of the same patients. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis using DD3-specific primers indicated that the expression of DD3 is very prostate specific because no product could be amplified in 18 different normal human tissues studied. Also, in a sampling of other tumor types and a large number of cell lines, no expression of DD3 could be detected. Molecular characterization of the DD3 transcription unit revealed that alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation occur. The fact that no extensive open reading frame could be found suggests that DD3 may function as a noncoding RNA. The DD3 gene was mapped to chromosome 9q21-22, and no homology of DD3 to any gene present in the computer databases was found. Our data indicate that DD3 is one of the most prostate cancer-specific genes yet described, and this makes DD3 a promising marker for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer and provides a powerful tool for the development of new treatment strategies for prostate cancer patients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The current recommendation of using transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUSB) to diagnose prostate cancer misses clinically significant (CS) cancers. More sensitive biopsies (eg, template prostate mapping biopsy [TPMB]) are too resource intensive for routine use, and there is little evidence on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MPMRI). OBJECTIVE To identify the most effective and cost-effective way of using these tests to detect CS prostate cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cost-effectiveness modelling of health outcomes and costs of men referred to secondary care with a suspicion of prostate cancer prior to any biopsy in the UK National Health Service using information from the diagnostic Prostate MR Imaging Study (PROMIS). INTERVENTION Combinations of MPMRI, TRUSB, and TPMB, using different definitions and diagnostic cut-offs for CS cancer. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Strategies that detect the most CS cancers given testing costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) given long-term costs. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS The use of MPMRI first and then up to two MRI-targeted TRUSBs detects more CS cancers per pound spent than a strategy using TRUSB first (sensitivity = 0.95 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.92-0.98] vs 0.91 [95% CI 0.86-0.94]) and is cost effective (ICER = {\pounds}7,076 [€8350/QALY gained]). The limitations stem from the evidence base in the accuracy of MRI-targeted biopsy and the long-term outcomes of men with CS prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS An MPMRI-first strategy is effective and cost effective for the diagnosis of CS prostate cancer. These findings are sensitive to the test costs, sensitivity of MRI-targeted TRUSB, and long-term outcomes of men with cancer, which warrant more empirical research. This analysis can inform the development of clinical guidelines. PATIENT SUMMARY We found that, under certain assumptions, the use of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging first and then up to two transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy is better than the current clinical standard and is good value for money.},

abstract = {The decision curve is a graphical summary recently proposed for assessing the potential clinical impact of risk prediction biomarkers or risk models for recommending treatment or intervention. It was applied recently in an article in Journal of Clinical Oncology to measure the impact of using a genomic risk model for deciding on adjuvant radiation therapy for prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy. We illustrate the use of decision curves for evaluating clinical- and biomarker-based models for predicting a man's risk of prostate cancer, which could be used to guide the decision to biopsy. Decision curves are grounded in a decision-theoretical framework that accounts for both the benefits of intervention and the costs of intervention to a patient who cannot benefit. Decision curves are thus an improvement over purely mathematical measures of performance such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. However, there are challenges in using and interpreting decision curves appropriately. We caution that decision curves cannot be used to identify the optimal risk threshold for recommending intervention. We discuss the use of decision curves for miscalibrated risk models. Finally, we emphasize that a decision curve shows the performance of a risk model in a population in which every patient has the same expected benefit and cost of intervention. If every patient has a personal benefit and cost, then the curves are not useful. If subpopulations have different benefits and costs, subpopulation-specific decision curves should be used. As a companion to this article, we released an R software package called DecisionCurve for making decision curves and related graphics.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The D'Amico risk group classification was originally developed to estimate the risk of biochemical recurrence following treatment for localized prostate cancer. We externally validated the ability of the risk groups to predict clinical progression, and cancer specific and overall survival following radical prostatectomy, and identify predictors of outcome in patients with high risk disease.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the records of 7,591 consecutive patients who underwent radical prostatectomy at our institution between 1987 and 2003. Postoperative survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to analyze the ability of the risk groups to predict survival and to evaluate the impact of clinicopathological factors on outcome in patients at high risk.\n\nRESULTS: Preoperative risk group stratification predicted the patient risk of biochemical and local recurrence, systemic progression, and cancer specific and overall survival (each p <0.001). The HR of death from prostate cancer after surgery in patients with high or intermediate risk disease was 11.5 (95% CI 5.9 to 22.3, p <0.0001) and 6.3 (95% CI 3.3 to 12.3, p <0.0001), respectively, compared to patients at low risk. In patients in the high risk group biopsy Gleason score (p = 0.006), pathological Gleason score (p = 0.006), pathological tumor stage (p = 0.04), positive lymph nodes (p = 0.02) and positive surgical margins (p = 0.008) predicted death from prostate cancer.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: We validated the ability of the risk group stratification to predict disease progression and patient survival following radical prostatectomy. Additional prognostic information from surgical staging may assist in individualized postoperative management, particularly for patients at high risk.},

abstract = {Only a very small fraction of the many tumor biomarkers discovered are successfully translated from the academic research laboratory into clinical practice. The pathway has not always been linear and has involved people with expertise in a wide range of specialties, including basic research, assay development, clinical affairs, regulatory affairs, marketing, business, oncology, and executive-management leadership. The experience with a tumor biomarker, the PCA3 [prostate cancer gene 3 (non-protein coding)] gene, illustrates the long and winding road that must be navigated. Here we reflect, from a historical point of view, on how the interface between academic science, industry, urologists, and clinical laboratories has been essential to advance biomarkers from solid basic science to a validated clinical laboratory test. PCA3 was first described as DD3 in 1999 by Bussemakers and colleagues (1). Researchers in the Isaacs laboratory at Johns Hopkins University used differential-display analysis to compare patterns of mRNA production in benign and malignant prostate tissue, with the goal of identifying unknown genes involved in prostate tumorigenesis. PCA3 expression was further characterized in the Schalken laboratory at Radboud University, Nijmegen (2), and this research confirmed 2 important properties of PCA3 as a prostate cancer (PCa)6 marker: PCA3 expression is prostate tissue specific, and PCA3 is highly overexpressed in PCa compared with benign tissue. This PCa-specific overexpression led the Nijmegen researchers to assess the feasibility of a PCA3 -based urine test for PCa detection. In 2001, a license for PCA3 was obtained by DiagnoCure, a company in Qu{\'{e}}bec City, Canada, to develop the assay and provide a clinical application. Transfer of a cancer biomarker to industry requires both the appropriate technology and a proper cancer strategy.

Methods Data were extracted from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial study data set on all men in the interventional arm, with 2 tests performed in a period of <2 years and with an initial result of the first test <4 ng/mL. The range of variation between first and second tests was computed. Risks of cancer stratified on Gleason score were computed using logistic regression. Results A total of 31,286 men had 2 PSA tests within 2 years and with an initial value <4 ng/mL. From the first to the second test, the median variation of PSA levels was 3.4% (interquartile range, -15% to +26%). The variation in PSA value was not associated with the delay between the first and the second test (P =.36), age (P =.16), body mass index (P =.41), and race (P = .12). A total of 2,781 prostate cancers were diagnosed during follow-up. Adjusting for age and initial PSA level, the risk of prostate cancer increased linearly with increasing PSA level at the second test, with an odds ratio of 1.079 (95% confidence interval, 1.058-1.101) for each percent increase in PSA level. However, the variation in PSA was not associated with a higher Gleason score (P =.95 for level variations in cancer of Gleason score <7 vs ≥7). Conclusion Although an increase in PSA level over time is associated with increased risk of prostate cancer, this association is not related to more aggressive tumors.},

Objective To evaluate the effect of a single prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening intervention and standardized diagnostic pathway on prostate cancer-specific mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants The Cluster Randomized Trial of PSA Testing for Prostate Cancer (CAP) included 419 582 men aged 50 to 69 years and was conducted at 573 primary care practices across the United Kingdom. Randomization and recruitment of the practices occurred between 2001 and 2009; patient follow-up ended on March 31, 2016. Intervention An invitation to attend a PSA testing clinic and receive a single PSA test vs standard (unscreened) practice. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcome: prostate cancer-specific mortality at a median follow-up of 10 years. Prespecified secondary outcomes: diagnostic cancer stage and Gleason grade (range, 2-10; higher scores indicate a poorer prognosis) of prostate cancers identified, all-cause mortality, and an instrumental variable analysis estimating the causal effect of attending the PSA screening clinic. Results Among 415 357 randomized men (mean [SD] age, 59.0 [5.6] years), 189 386 in the intervention group and 219 439 in the control group were included in the analysis (n = 408 825; 98%).

The number diagnosed with prostate cancer was higher in the intervention group (n = 8054; 4.3%) than in the control group (n = 7853; 3.6%) (RR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.14 to 1.25]; P < .001). More prostate cancer tumors with a Gleason grade of 6 or lower were identified in the intervention group (n = 3263/189 386 [1.7%]) than in the control group (n = 2440/219 439 [1.1%]) (difference per 1000 men, 6.11 [95% CI, 5.38 to 6.84]; P < .001). In the analysis of all-cause mortality, there were 25 459 deaths in the intervention group vs 28 306 deaths in the control group (RR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.94 to 1.03]; P = .49). In the instrumental variable analysis for prostate cancer mortality, the adherence-adjusted causal RR was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.67 to 1.29; P = .66). Conclusions and Relevance Among practices randomized to a single PSA screening intervention vs standard practice without screening, there was no significant difference in prostate cancer mortality after a median follow-up of 10 years but the detection of low-risk prostate cancer cases increased. Although longer-term follow-up is under way, the findings do not support single PSA testing for population-based screening. Trial Registration ISRCTN Identifier: ISRCTN92187251.},

abstract = {Objectives. To analyze the relationship of age and race to prostate- specific antigen (PSA) levels among participants in a community-based study. Methods. A total of 77,700 records of men aged 40 to 79 years were analyzed from a longitudinal study of PSA conducted during Prostate Cancer Awareness Week 1993 and 1994. Records from 1994 were not included for men who were tested in 1993. All cases of prostate cancer were excluded. Records with outlier PSA values greater than 20 ng/mL were eliminated from the analysis (n = 190; 24%). Results. Mean PSA values (ng/mL) of 10-year age groups differed significantly (P <0.0001) between each group (ages 40-49, 0.83; 50-59, 1.23; 60-69, 1.83; 70-79, 2.31). In each successively older age group, PSA variance increased significantly (P = 0.0001). Standard deviations (SD) by age group were: 40-49, 0,79;50-59, 1.33;60-69, 1.94; and 70-79,2.35. Significant differences in mean PSA by race were found. Pairwise differences in mean PSA were found between whites and blacks, whites and Latinos, blacks and Asians, and Asians and Latinos (P <0.0001). No statistically significant differences in PSA variance between racial groups were found. Age-within-race analysis resulted in consistent statistical significance when comparing variance among age cohorts in each race. Conclusions. Age-specific PSA reference ranges are a result of the increasing mean PSA and increasing PSA variance in successively older cohorts of men. Mean PSA values differ significantly by race, but differences in PSA variance do not. The clinical significance of race-specific PSA reference ranges has yet to be determined.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To study the impact of race in an equal access care institution with a predominantly African-American (AA) population.\n\nMETHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data from 222 men with low risk (LR) or intermediate risk (IR) prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy at the New York Harbor VA between 2003 and 2011. Biochemical relapse, distant control, and prostate cancer-specific survival were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression modeling was performed to determine the impact of covariates on biochemical outcome.\n\nRESULTS: Most patients (65.3 %) were AA. The median follow-up was 58 months, and 89.6 % of patients were followed for a minimum of 2 years after their surgery. Analyzing the whole cohort, the biochemical control was improved in Caucasian patients compared with AA (90.2 vs. 75.4 %, p = 0.008). On subgroup analysis, for IR disease, this difference was no longer significant, 80.5 % for Caucasians versus 69.8 % for AA (p = 0.36). However, for LR disease, the 5-year biochemical control remained significantly improved for Caucasians compared with AA, with a 5-year biochemical control of 97.6 versus 81.7 %, p = 0.006. On multivariate analysis, AA race was a significant predictor for biochemical recurrence (HR 2.69, 95 % CI 1.27-5.65, p = 0.009). There were no differences between the two groups regarding distant control (p = 0.14) or prostate cancer-specific survival (p = 0.29).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In this predominant AA population with equal access to medical care, AA race is an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy in men with LR or IR prostate cancer.},

abstract = {Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that employs a variety of statistical, probabilistic and optimization techniques that allows computers to "learn" from past examples and to detect hard-to-discern patterns from large, noisy or complex data sets. This capability is particularly well-suited to medical applications, especially those that depend on complex proteomic and genomic measurements. As a result, machine learning is frequently used in cancer diagnosis and detection. More recently machine learning has been applied to cancer prognosis and prediction. This latter approach is particularly interesting as it is part of a growing trend towards personalized, predictive medicine. In assembling this review we conducted a broad survey of the different types of machine learning methods being used, the types of data being integrated and the performance of these methods in cancer prediction and prognosis. A number of trends are noted, including a growing dependence on protein biomarkers and microarray data, a strong bias towards applications in prostate and breast cancer, and a heavy reliance on "older" technologies such artificial neural networks (ANNs) instead of more recently developed or more easily interpretable machine learning methods. A number of published studies also appear to lack an appropriate level of validation or testing. Among the better designed and validated studies it is clear that machine learning methods can be used to substantially (15-25%) improve the accuracy of predicting cancer susceptibility, recurrence and mortality. At a more fundamental level, it is also evident that machine learning is also helping to improve our basic understanding of cancer development and progression.},

Recent comprehensive analysis of 500 prostates has more precisely defined its anatomic composition, identifying previously undetected features and unsuspected complexities. Using a three-dimensional model, these structures and relationships are demonstrated. Four basic anatomic regions are described. The relationship of each to the urethra provides a central anatomic refer-ence point. I . Theperipherul zone constitutes over 70% of the glandular prostate. It forms a disc of tissue whose ducts radiate laterally from the urethra lateral and distal to the vemmontanum. Almost all carcinomas arise here. close to the ejaculatory duct orifices and follow these ducts proximally, branching lat-erally near the prostate base. Its lateral border fuses with the proximal peripheral zone border, completing in continuity with the peripheral zone, a full disc of secretory tissue oriented in a coronal plane. Marked histologic differences between central and peripheral zones suggest important biologic differences. 3. Preprostatic region. The urethral segment proximal to the verumontanum is kinked anteriorly at a 35-degree angle to the distal segment. No major ducts arise in the proximal segment, but the lateral rows of peripheral zone orifices continue. Duct development is aborted here, producing only a small transition zone and several tinier periurrthral ducts. The development of these small ducts is possibly determined and limited by their intimate relationship to a periurethral smooth muscle sphincter that exists only proximal to the verumontanum. These small ducts in a restricted area are the exclusive site of nodular hyperplasia (BPH) origin. 4. The unteriorfibromusculnr stromu forms the entire anterior surface of the prostate as a thick, nonglandular apron, shielding from view the anterior surface of the three glandular regions. Its inseparable fusion to the glandular prostate has prob-ably delayed recognition of the anatomic features described here. 2. The centrul zone constitutes 25% of the glandular prostate.

Incidence data, available through 2015, were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data, available through 2016, were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2019, 1,762,450 new cancer cases and 606,880 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. Over the past decade of data, the cancer incidence rate (2006-2015) was stable in women and declined by approximately 2\% per year in men, whereas the cancer death rate (2007-2016) declined annually by 1.4\% and 1.8\%, respectively. The overall cancer death rate dropped continuously from 1991 to 2016 by a total of 27\%, translating into approximately 2,629,200 fewer cancer deaths than would have been expected if death rates had remained at their peak. Although the racial gap in cancer mortality is slowly narrowing, socioeconomic inequalities are widening, with the most notable gaps for the most preventable cancers. For example, compared with the most affluent counties, mortality rates in the poorest counties were 2-fold higher for cervical cancer and 40\% higher for male lung and liver cancers during 2012-2016. Some states are home to both the wealthiest and the poorest counties, suggesting the opportunity for more equitable dissemination of effective cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment strategies. A broader application of existing cancer control knowledge with an emphasis on disadvantaged groups would undoubtedly accelerate progress against cancer.},

abstract = {Context: Prostate cancer (PCa) remains one of the most diagnosed malignancies in the world, correlating with regions where men consume more of a so-called Western-style diet. As such, there is much interest in understanding the role of lifestyle and diet on the incidence and progression of PCa. Objective: To provide a summary of published literature with regard to dietary macro- and micronutrients and PCa incidence and progression. Evidence acquisition: A literature search was completed using the PubMed database for all studies published on diet and PCa in June 2012 or earlier. Primary literature and meta-analyses were given preference over other review articles when possible. Evidence synthesis: The literature was reviewed on seven dietary components: carbohydrates, protein, fat and cholesterol, vegetables, vitamins and minerals, and phytochemicals. Current literature linking these nutrients to PCa is limited at best, but trends in the published data suggest consumption of carbohydrates, saturated and $\omega$-6 fats, and certain vitamin supplements may promote PCa risk and progression. Conversely, consumption of many plant phytochemicals and $\omega$-3 fatty acids seem to slow the risk and progression of the disease. All other nutrients seem to have no effect or data are inconclusive. A brief summary about the clinical implications of dietary interventions with respect to PCa prevention, treatment, and survivorship is provided. Conclusions: Due to the number and heterogeneity of published studies investigating diet and PCa, it is difficult to determine what nutrients make up the perfect diet for the primary and secondary prevention of PCa. Because diets are made of multiple macro- and micronutrients, further prospective studies are warranted, particularly those investigating the relationship between whole foods instead of a single nutritional component. {\textcopyright} 2012 European Association of Urology.},

We included reports addressing the CAPRA (n = 13), CAPRA-S (n = 4), and J-CAPRA (n = 5) scores. External validation studies for the CAPRA score have yielded favorable clinical performance in both academic and community cohorts, with concordance index (c-index) for biochemical recurrence (BCR) after definitive treatment in the range of 0.66–0.81. Validation studies addressing the postsurgical CAPRA-S score have demonstrated favorable prediction of distant end points (c-index for BCR: 0.73–0.80; prostate cancer–specific mortality [PCSM]: 0.75–0.88). The J-CAPRA score was evaluated in 1378 men treated with primary ADT and demonstrated excellent discrimination (c-index for progression-free survival: 0.80–0.89; PCSM: 0.820–0.836; overall survival: 0.665–0.700).

Although individual PSA values were known to fluctuate in the short and long term, the influence of insolation and seasons on PSA had not been addressed to date. To assert the relationship between total and free PSA and meteorological data in 8644 participants (55-70 years) in the French arm of the ERSPC study. Methods: Blood sample was taken at the local laboratory after informed consent and frozen sera were sent for central testing of total and free PSA. PSA measurement was performed within 7 days on the Access 1.0 automat with Hybritech reagents. Monthly meteorological data - insolation, daily temperatures and rain precipitations - were obtained from the local branches of the National Meteorology Agency. Results: Total PSA - but not free PSA - was correlated with insolation, that is the monthly accrual in hours of sunshine during which the intensity was higher than 120 Watt.m-2(r = 0.05 (95%CI: 0.03-0.07; p < 0.0001)) while no relationships were shown between insolation and percent-free PSA (free PSA divided by the total PSA). Interdependence between total PSA and insolation was also apparent with respect to the 3 ng/mL ERSPC cutoff for recommending biopsies (213.1 vs. 206.2 hours, p = 0.004). Such relationship was even more evident in summer when the tested participants more often had a PSA > 3 ng/mL (17.1% vs. 14.3%, p = 0.0006) than in the rest of the year, resulting in 23% more chances of being referred for biopsies (Odds ratio 1.23, 95%CI: 1.10-1.40). Conclusions: Total PSA was shown to be strongly associated with insolation and seasons while the percent-free PSA was not influenced. {\textcopyright} 2006 European Association of Urology.},

abstract = {Purpose: The true accuracy of different biopsy strategies for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer is unknown, given the positive evaluation bias required for verification by radical prostatectomy. To evaluate how well different biopsy strategies perform at detecting clinically significant prostate cancer we used computer simulation in cystoprostatectomy cases with cancer. Materials and Methods: A computer simulation study was performed on prostates acquired at radical cystoprostatectomy. A total of 346 prostates were processed and examined for prostate cancer using 3 mm whole mount slices. The 96 prostates that contained cancer were digitally reconstructed. Biopsy simulations incorporating various degrees of random localization error were performed using the reconstructed 3-dimensional prostate computer model. Each biopsy strategy was simulated 500 times. Two definitions of clinically significant prostate cancer were used to define the reference standard, including definition 1 - Gleason score 7 or greater, and/or lesion volume 0.5 ml or greater and definition 2 - Gleason score 7 or greater, and/or lesion volume 0.2 ml or greater. Results: A total of 215 prostate cancer foci were present. The ROC AUC to detect and rule out definition 1 prostate cancer was 0.69, 0.75, 0.82 and 0.91 for 12-core transrectal ultrasound biopsy with a random localization error of 15 and 10 mm, 14-core transrectal ultrasound biopsy and template prostate mapping using a 5 mm sampling frame, respectively. Conclusions: To our knowledge our biopsy simulation study is the first to evaluate the performance of different sampling strategies to detect clinically important prostate cancer in a population that better reflects the demographics of a screened cohort. Compared to other strategies standard transrectal ultrasound biopsy performs poorly for detecting clinically important cancer. Marginal improvement can be achieved using additional cores placed anterior but the performance attained by template prostate mapping is optimal. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.},

abstract = {For the past few years, we've had the opportunity, as software engineers, to observe the development of computational-science software (called codes) built for high-performance-computing (HPC) machines in many different contexts. Although we haven't studied all types of HPC development, we've encountered a wide cross-section of projects. Despite these projects' diversity, several common traits exist: Many developers receive their software training from other scientists. Although the scientists often have been writing software for many years, they generally lack formal software engineering (SE) training, especially in managing multiperson development teams and complex software artifacts. Many of the codes aren't initially designed to be large. They start small and then grow on the basis of their scientific success. Many development teams use their own code (or code developed as part of their research group). For these reasons (and many others), development ■ ■ ■ practices in this community differ considerably from those in more “traditional” SE. We aim here to distill our experience about how software engineers can productively engage the HPC community. Several SE practices generally considered good ideas in other development environments are quite mismatched to the HPC community's needs. For SE researchers, the keys to successful interactions include a healthy sense of humility and the avoidance of assumptions that SE expertise applies equally in all contexts.},

abstract = {Recurrent chromosomal rearrangements have not been well characterized in common carcinomas. We used a bioinformatics approach to discover can-didate oncogenic chromosomal aberrations on the basis of outlier gene expression. Two ETS transcription factors, ERG and ETV1, were identified as outliers in prostate cancer. We identified recurrent gene fusions of the 5 untranslated region of TMPRSS2 to ERG or ETV1 in prostate cancer tissues with outlier expression. By using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we dem-onstrated that 23 of 29 prostate cancer samples harbor rearrangements in ERG or ETV1. Cell line experiments suggest that the androgen-responsive promoter elements of TMPRSS2 mediate the overexpression of ETS family members in prostate cancer. These results have implications in the devel-opment of carcinomas and the molecular diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.},

abstract = {Many criteria can be used to evaluate the performance of supervised learning. Different criteria are appropriate in different settings, and it is not always clear which criteria to use. A further complication is that learning methods that perform well on one criterion may not perform well on other criteria. For example, SVMs and boosting are de- signed to optimize accuracy, whereas neural nets typically optimize squared error or cross entropy. We conducted an empirical study using a variety of learning methods (SVMs, neural nets, k-nearest neighbor, bagged and boosted trees, and boosted stumps) to compare nine boolean classifica- tion performance metrics: Accuracy, Lift, F-Score, Area under the ROC Curve, Average Precision, Precision/Recall Break-Even Point, Squared Error, Cross Entropy, and Prob- ability Calibration. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) shows that these metrics span a low dimensional manifold. The three metrics that are appropriate when predictions are in- terpreted as probabilities: squared error, cross entropy, and calibration, lay in one part of metric space far away from metrics that depend on the relative order of the predicted values: ROC area, average precision, break-even point, and lift. In between them fall two metrics that depend on com- paring predictions to a threshold: accuracy and F-score. As expected, maximum margin methods such as SVMs and boosted trees have excellent performance on metrics like ac- curacy, but perform poorly on probability metrics such as squared error. What was not expected was that the mar- gin methods have excellent performance on ordering metrics such as ROC area and average precision. We introduce a new metric, SAR, that combines squared error, accuracy, and ROC area into one metric. MDS and correlation anal- ysis shows that SAR is centrally located and correlates well with other metrics, suggesting that it is a good general pur- posemetric to use whenmore specific criteria are not known.},

Unfortunately, for students who are preparing for a research career, this type of curriculum fails to address many of the day-to-day organizational challenges associated with performing computational experiments. In practice, the principles behind organizing and documenting computational experiments are often learned on the fly, and this learning is strongly influenced by personal predilections as well as by chance interactions with collaborators or colleagues. The purpose of this article is to describe one good strategy for carrying out computational experiments. I will not describe profound issues such as how to formulate hypotheses, design experiments, or draw conclusions. Rather, I will focus on relatively mundane issues such as organizing files and directories and documenting progress. These issues are important because poor organizational choices can lead to significantly slower research progress. I do not claim that the strategies I outline here are optimal. These are simply the principles and practices that I have developed over 12 years of bioinformatics research, augmented with various suggestions from other researchers with whom I have discussed these issues.},

While sensitivity is slightly weaker than that of seric PSA, specificity as well as positive and negative predictive values are quite better. PCA3 test seems therefore to be a good indicator of prostate biopsy results.

@article{Scattoni2013,
abstract = {Purpose: We performed a head-to-head comparison of the PHI (Prostate Health Index) and PCA3. Materials and Methods: We evaluated PHI and PCA3 performance in 211 patients undergoing initial (116) or repeat (95) prostate biopsy. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was done using the AUC to test the accuracy of PHI and PCA3 for predicting prostate cancer in the overall population and in each setting. Decision curve analysis was used to compare the clinical benefit of different models. Results: Overall, the AUC of the PHI (0.70) was significantly higher than the AUC of PCA3 (0.59), total prostate specific antigen (0.56) and free-to-total prostate specific antigen (0.60) (p = 0.043, 0.002 and 0.037, respectively). PHI was more accurate than PCA3 for predicting prostate cancer in the initial setting (AUC 0.69 vs 0.57) and in the repeat setting (AUC 0.72 vs 0.63), although no statistically significant difference was observed. Including PCA3 in the base multivariable model (prostate specific antigen plus free-to-total prostate specific antigen plus prostate volume) did not increase predictive accuracy in either setting (AUC 0.79 vs 0.80 and 0.75 vs 0.76, respectively). Conversely, including PHI in the base multivariable model improved predictive accuracy by 5% (AUC 0.79 to 0.84) and 6% (AUC 0.75 to 0.81) in the initial and repeat prostate biopsy settings, respectively. On decision curve analysis the highest net benefit was observed when PHI was added to the base multivariable model. Conclusions: PHI and PCA3 provide a significant increase in sensitivity and specificity compared to all other examined markers and they may help guide biopsy decisions. PCA3 does not increase the accuracy of predicting prostate cancer when PHI is assessed. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.},

In this review, we seek to clarify some of these issues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Review of published medical literature relating to the anatomy of the pelvic fascia including a Pubmed search using the terms - pelvic fascia, Denonvilliers' fascia, prostate capsule, neurovascular bundle of Walsh, puboprostatic ligament and the detrusor apron. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the study were as follows: 1. The 'capsule' of the prostate does not exist. Rather, the fibromuscular band surrounding the prostate forms an integral part of the gland. 2. The prostate is surrounded by fascial structures - anteriorly/anterolaterally by the prostatic fascia and posteriorly by the Denonvilliers' fascia. Laterally, the prostatic fascia merges with the endopelvic fascia. 3. The posterior longitudinal fascia of the detrusor comprises a 'posterior layer' of the detrusor apron, extending from the bladder neck to the prostate base. 4. The neurovascular structures tend to be located posterolaterally, but may not always form a bundle. A significant proportion of fibres may lie away from the main nerve structures, along the lateral/posterior aspects of the prostate.},

abstract = {Objectives. To analyze the relationship of age and race to prostate- specific antigen (PSA) levels among participants in a community-based study. Methods. A total of 77,700 records of men aged 40 to 79 years were analyzed from a longitudinal study of PSA conducted during Prostate Cancer Awareness Week 1993 and 1994. Records from 1994 were not included for men who were tested in 1993. All cases of prostate cancer were excluded. Records with outlier PSA values greater than 20 ng/mL were eliminated from the analysis (n = 190; 24%). Results. Mean PSA values (ng/mL) of 10-year age groups differed significantly (P <0.0001) between each group (ages 40-49, 0.83; 50-59, 1.23; 60-69, 1.83; 70-79, 2.31). In each successively older age group, PSA variance increased significantly (P = 0.0001). Standard deviations (SD) by age group were: 40-49, 0,79;50-59, 1.33;60-69, 1.94; and 70-79,2.35. Significant differences in mean PSA by race were found. Pairwise differences in mean PSA were found between whites and blacks, whites and Latinos, blacks and Asians, and Asians and Latinos (P <0.0001). No statistically significant differences in PSA variance between racial groups were found. Age-within-race analysis resulted in consistent statistical significance when comparing variance among age cohorts in each race. Conclusions. Age-specific PSA reference ranges are a result of the increasing mean PSA and increasing PSA variance in successively older cohorts of men. Mean PSA values differ significantly by race, but differences in PSA variance do not. The clinical significance of race-specific PSA reference ranges has yet to be determined.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) and TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion are promising prostate cancer (PCa) specific biomarkers. Our aim was to simultaneously quantify the expression levels of PCA3 and TMPRSS2:ERG in a panel of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), normal prostate adjacent to PCa (NP) and PCa tissue samples, to provide a rational basis for the understanding of the false-positive and false-negative results of the urine assays. METHODS: The tissue samples were carefully histopathologically characterized to obtain homogeneous groups. The mRNA was isolated, transcribed into cDNA and the relative expressions of PCA3 and TMPRSS2:ERG were measured using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The expression levels of PCA3 and TMPRSS2:ERG were compared between the different groups. RESULTS: We included 48 BPH, 32 NP, and 48 PCa. The PCA3 expression levels progressively increased from BPH to NP (3 times) and finally to PCa (30 times). There were one false-positive sample and seven false-negative samples. The TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion was found in 8.3% of the BPH, 15.6% of the NP, and 50% of the PCa samples. The use of TMPRSS2:ERG in the PCA3 negative cases allowed diagnosis of four of the seven false-negative samples and added one false-positive, but we had to define a cut-off value to avoid eight false-positive results. CONCLUSIONS: Considering tissue expression of the markers, most of the false-negative results of the PCA3 test were corrected by TMPRSS2:ERG (57%) and the combination of both had a higher sensitivity for PCa diagnosis. Some of the control samples did express TMPRSS2:ERG and a cut-off value had to be defined to avoid false-positive results.},

abstract = {Many tumor cells shed specialized membrane vesicles known as exosomes. In this study, we show that pretreatment of mice with exosomes produced by TS/A or 4T.1 murine mammary tumor cells resulted in accelerated growth of implanted tumor cells in both syngeneic BALB/c mice and nude mice. As implanted TS/A tumor cells grew more rapidly in mice that had been depleted of NK cells, we analyzed the effects of the tumor-derived exosomes on NK cells. The tumor-derived exosomes inhibit NK cell cytotoxic activity ex vivo and in vitro as demonstrated by chromium release assays. The treatment of mice with TS/A tumor exosomes also led to a reduction in the percentages of NK cells, as determined by FACS analysis, in the lungs and spleens. Key features of NK cell activity were inhibited, including release of perforin but not granzyme B, as well as the expression of cyclin D3 and activation of the Jak3-mediated pathways. Human tumor cell lines also were found to produce exosomes that were capable of inhibiting IL-2-stimulated NK cell proliferation. Exosomes produced by dendritic cells or B cells did not. The presentation of tumor Ags by exosomes is under consideration as a cancer vaccine strategy; however, we found that pretreatment of mice with tumor exosomes blunted the protective effect of syngeneic dendritic cells pulsed ex vivo with tumor exosomes. We propose that tumor exosomes contribute to the growth of tumors by blocking IL-2-mediated activation of NK cells and their cytotoxic response to tumor cells.},

abstract = {Cell-free circulating DNA in plasma and serum may serve as a biomarker for malignant tumor detection and follow up in patients with a variety of solid tumors including prostate cancer. In healthy patients, DNA is normally released from an apoptotic source which generates small fragments of cell-free DNA, whereas cancer patients have cell-free circulating DNA that originated from necrosis, autophagy, or mitotic catastrophe. Cell-free circulating DNA levels were measured by a quantitative real-time PCR method with a set of primers targeted to amplify the consensus ALU apoptotic versus necrotic origin. Prostate cancer patients before and 3 months after diagnosis showed cell-free circulating DNA released at apoptotic and non-apoptotic cell death. Interestingly, all patients after 6 months demonstrated DNA released at non-apoptotic cell. The principal source of cell-free circulating DNA is of apoptotic and non-apoptotic cell death. However, during treatment, this feature could change. Therefore, the study of cell-free circulating DNA would be important to follow the evolution of the disease during the treatment.},

abstract = {Background Ranibizumab — a recombinant, humanized, monoclonal antibody Fab that neu- tralizes all active forms of vascular endothelial growth factor A — has been evaluated for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration. Methods In this multicenter, 2-year, double-blind, sham-controlled study, we randomly as- signed patients with age-related macular degeneration with either minimally classic or occult (with no classic lesions) choroidal neovascularization to receive 24 monthly intravitreal injections of ranibizumab (either 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg) or sham injections. The primary end point was the proportion of patients losing fewer than 15 letters from baseline visual acuity at 12 months. Results We enrolled 716 patients in the study. At 12 months, 94.5% of the group given 0.3 mg of ranibizumab and 94.6% of those given 0.5 mg lost fewer than 15 letters, as com- pared with 62.2% of patients receiving sham injections (P<0.001 for both compari- sons). Visual acuity improved by 15 or more letters in 24.8% of the 0.3-mg group and 33.8% of the 0.5-mg group, as compared with 5.0% of the sham-injection group (P<0.001 for both doses). Mean increases in visual acuity were 6.5 letters in the 0.3-mg group and 7.2 letters in the 0.5-mg group, as compared with a decrease of 10.4 letters in the sham-injection group (P<0.001 for both comparisons). The benefit in visual acuity was maintained at 24 months. During 24 months, presumed endoph- thalmitis was identified in five patients (1.0%) and serious uveitis in six patients (1.3%) given ranibizumab.n (MARINA) Study Group are listed in the Appendix.

abstract = {PURPOSE: We previously reported that a panel of four kallikrein forms in blood-total, free, and intact prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and kallikrein-related peptidase 2 (hK2)-can reduce unnecessary biopsy in previously unscreened men with elevated total PSA. We aimed to replicate our findings in a large, independent, representative, population-based cohort.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: The study cohort included 2,914 previously unscreened men undergoing biopsy as a result of elevated PSA (> or = 3 ng/mL) in the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer, Rotterdam, with 807 prostate cancers (28%) detected. The cohort was randomly divided 1:3 into a training and validation set. Levels of kallikrein markers were compared with biopsy outcome.\n\nRESULTS: Addition of free PSA, intact PSA, and hK2 to a model containing total PSA and age improved the area under the curve from 0.64 to 0.76 and 0.70 to 0.78 for models without and with digital rectal examination results, respectively (P < .001 for both). Application of the panel to 1,000 men with elevated PSA would reduce the number of biopsies by 513 and miss 54 of 177 low-grade cancers and 12 of 100 high-grade cancers. Findings were robust to sensitivity analysis.\n\nCONCLUSION: We have replicated our previously published finding that a panel of four kallikreins can predict the result of biopsy for prostate cancer in men with elevated PSA. Use of this panel would dramatically reduce biopsy rates. A small number of men with cancer would be advised against immediate biopsy, but these men would have predominately low-stage, low-grade disease.},

abstract = {Background Despite revisions in 2005 and 2014, the Gleason prostate cancer (PCa) grading system still has major deficiencies. Combining of Gleason scores into a three-tiered grouping (6, 7, 8-10) is used most frequently for prognostic and therapeutic purposes. The lowest score, assigned 6, may be misunderstood as a cancer in the middle of the grading scale, and 3 + 4 = 7 and 4 + 3 = 7 are often considered the same prognostic group. Objective To verify that a new grading system accurately produces a smaller number of grades with the most significant prognostic differences, using multi-institutional and multimodal therapy data. Design, setting, and participants Between 2005 and 2014, 20 845 consecutive men were treated by radical prostatectomy at five academic institutions; 5501 men were treated with radiotherapy at two academic institutions. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Outcome was based on biochemical recurrence (BCR). The log-rank test assessed univariable differences in BCR by Gleason score. Separate univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards used four possible categorizations of Gleason scores. Results and limitations In the surgery cohort, we found large differences in recurrence rates between both Gleason 3 + 4 versus 4 + 3 and Gleason 8 versus 9. The hazard ratios relative to Gleason score 6 were 1.9, 5.1, 8.0, and 11.7 for Gleason scores 3 + 4, 4 + 3, 8, and 9-10, respectively. These differences were attenuated in the radiotherapy cohort as a whole due to increased adjuvant or neoadjuvant hormones for patients with high-grade disease but were clearly seen in patients undergoing radiotherapy only. A five-grade group system had the highest prognostic discrimination for all cohorts on both univariable and multivariable analysis. The major limitation was the unavoidable use of prostate-specific antigen BCR as an end point as opposed to cancer-related death. Conclusions The new PCa grading system has these benefits: more accurate grade stratification than current systems, simplified grading system of five grades, and lowest grade is 1, as opposed to 6, with the potential to reduce overtreatment of PCa. Patient summary We looked at outcomes for prostate cancer (PCa) treated with radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy and validated a new grading system with more accurate grade stratification than current systems, including a simplified grading system of five grades and a lowest grade is 1, as opposed to 6, with the potential to reduce overtreatment of PCa.},

abstract = {Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among men in the United States. Recently, fusion of TMPRSS2 with ETS family oncogenic transcription factors has been identified as a common molecular alteration in prostate cancer, where most often the rearrangement places ERG under the androgen-regulated transcriptional control of TMPRSS2. Here, we carried out rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) on a prostate cancer specimen carrying an atypical aberration discovered by array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH), suggesting an alternative fusion partner of ERG. We identified novel transcribed sequences fused to ERG, mapping 4 kb upstream of the TMPRSS2 start site. The sequences derive from an apparent second TMPRSS2 isoform, which we found also expressed in some prostate tumors, suggesting similar androgen-regulated control. In a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based survey of 63 prostate tumor specimens (54 primary and nine lymph node metastases), 44 (70%) cases expressed either the known or novel variant TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, 28 (44%) expressed both, 10 (16%) expressed only the known, and notably six (10%) expressed only the variant isoform fusion. In this specimen set, the presence of a TMPRSS2-ERG fusion showed no statistical association with tumor stage, Gleason grade or recurrence-free survival. Nonetheless, the discovery of a novel variant TMPRSS2 isoform-ERG fusion adds to the characterization of ETS-family rearrangements in prostate cancer, and has important implications for the accurate molecular diagnosis of TMPRSS2-ETS fusions.},

abstract = {Prostate cancer was diagnosed in life among 274 of 8006 (3.6%) members of a cohort of Japanese men in Hawaii between 1965 and 1990. Only 55 (20%) of the 274 diagnosed cases died with prostate cancer, and they accounted for only 2% of the 2893 deaths that occurred among the men during this period. None of the 61 men whose tumor was found incidentally to a transurethral resection died as a result of this cancer, while it was the cause of death of 9 of 106 (8%) men with clinical cancer localized to the prostate. Forty-six of the 107 (43%) men with more extensive disease at the time of diagnosis died from prostate cancer. Step sectioning of the prostate identified prostate cancer in 80 of 293 (27%) autopsied Hawaii Japanese men who died after 50 years of age, reaching a frequency of 63% (10 of 16) among men over 80 years of age. The volume of 48 (60%) of these cancers was less than 150 mm3. These small tumors would probably not have been discovered in a screening program. Tumors larger than 1000 mm3 would probably be discovered using modern diagnostic procedures but were found in only 13 (4.4%) of the autopsied men. It is likely that a screening program to detect and treat such large, unsuspected tumors in this population would have had little impact upon the already low proportion of deaths due to prostate cancer among these Japanese men.},

Current methodologies for undertaking environmental-impact assessments may not be suitable for use under near-future (2100) conditions. This paper reviews and analyses what research has presently been undertaken to address these concerns. The authors find that little attention has previously been paid to chronic-exposure conditions that accurately reflect the near future, but the few available studies show that the consequences of oceanic climate change will not only be significant for marine life, but also impact humans who depend on it. The authors suggest that future research should target understanding how climate change will impact the physiological health of a wide array of species, important both economically and ecologically, going beyond the often-chosen model species and standardized testing. This information is necessary to accurately estimate the environmental risk of proposed engineering projects in changing environmental conditions.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE In 2005, the University of California, San Francisco developed the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (UCSF-CAPRA) score as a new risk stratification tool. The UCSF-CAPRA, which ranges from 0 to 10 points, consists of five clinical variables, prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, T stage, percent of positive biopsies and age. The aim of this study was to validate the UCSF-CAPRA score for Japanese prostate cancer patients receiving radical prostatectomy using the contemporary Gleason grading. METHODS From 1999 to 2010, 211 men who underwent radical prostatectomy were used for validation. Biochemical progression-free survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the UCSF-CAPRA and D'Amico risk categories were compared using the log-rank method. The concordance index (c-index) for the UCSF-CAPRA and D'Amico risk classification was calculated. RESULTS Using the UCSF-CAPRA score, 85 (40.3%), 106 (50.2%) and 20 (9.5%) subjects were stratified as 0-2 points (low risk), 3-5 points (intermediate risk) and 6-10 points (high risk). Using the D'Amico risk criteria, 66 (31.3%), 89 (42.2%) and 56 (26.5%) were stratified as low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the UCSF-CAPRA divided the patients significantly into each risk category. There was no significant difference between low and intermediate in the D'Amico risk classification. The c-index of the UCSF-CAPRA and D'Amico classification was 0.755 and 0.713, respectively. CONCLUSION The UCSF-CAPRA is an acceptable risk category tool comparable to that of the D'Amico risk classification for Japanese prostate cancer patients receiving radical prostatectomy in the contemporary Gleason grading era.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The measurement of gene expression in post-digital rectal examination (DRE) urine specimens provides a non-invasive method to determine a patient's risk of prostate cancer. Many currently available assays use whole urine or cell pellets for the analysis of prostate cancer-associated genes, although the use of extracellular vesicles (EVs) has also recently been of interest. We investigated the expression of prostate-, kidney-, and bladder-specific transcripts and known prostate cancer biomarkers in urine EVs. METHODS Cell pellets and EVs were recovered from post-DRE urine specimens, with the total RNA yield and quality determined by Bioanalyzer. The levels of prostate, kidney, and bladder-associated transcripts in EVs were assessed by TaqMan qPCR and targeted sequencing. RESULTS RNA was more consistently recovered from the urine EV specimens, with over 80% of the patients demonstrating higher RNA yields in the EV fraction as compared to urine cell pellets. The median EV RNA yield of 36.4 ng was significantly higher than the median urine cell pellet RNA yield of 4.8 ng. Analysis of the post-DRE urine EVs indicated that prostate-specific transcripts were more abundant than kidney- or bladder-specific transcripts. Additionally, patients with prostate cancer had significantly higher levels of the prostate cancer-associated genes PCA3 and ERG. CONCLUSIONS Post-DRE urine EVs are a viable source of prostate-derived RNAs for biomarker discovery and prostate cancer status can be distinguished from analysis of these specimens. Continued analysis of urine EVs offers the potential discovery of novel biomarkers for pre-biopsy prostate cancer detection.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer arises in the transition zone (TZ) in approximately 20-25% of cases. Modern biopsy and surveillance protocols, and advances in prostate cancer imaging, have renewed interest in TZ prostate cancers. We compared TZ and PZ prostate cancer to determine if cancer location is independently associated with better outcomes.\n\nMETHODS: We evaluated an expanded cohort of 1354 men who underwent radical prostatectomy between 1983 and 2003 with updated long-term clinical follow-up. Regression models were used to compare the volume of high-grade (Gleason 4 or 5) cancer and total cancer volume by location. Uni- and multi-variable logistic regression models tested the associations between cancer location and adverse pathologic features. Multivariable proportional hazard models were fit to examine cancer recurrence.\n\nRESULTS: Patients with TZ cancer presented with higher pre-operative serum PSA values (11.07 vs. 7.86 ng/ml) and larger total cancer volume (7.1 vs. 3.8 cc). Patients with TZ cancer had decreased odds of seminal vesicle invasion (OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.03, 0.21), extra-capsular extension (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.35, 0.92), and lymphovascular invasion (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.27, 0.87) in multivariable models. TZ cancers were independently associated with decreased hazard of tumor recurrence (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.43, 0.90).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: TZ cancer prostate is associated with favorable pathologic features and better recurrence-free survival despite being diagnosed with larger cancers and higher PSA values. Tumor location should be taken into account when stratifying patient risk before and after prostatectomy, particularly with the evolving role of imaging in prostate cancer management.},

abstract = {Cancer has been characterized as a heterogeneous disease consisting of many different subtypes. The early diagnosis and prognosis of a cancer type have become a necessity in cancer research, as it can facilitate the subsequent clinical management of patients. The importance of classifying cancer patients into high or low risk groups has led many research teams, from the biomedical and the bioinformatics field, to study the application of machine learning (ML) methods. Therefore, these techniques have been utilized as an aim to model the progression and treatment of cancerous conditions. In addition, the ability of ML tools to detect key features from complex datasets reveals their importance. A variety of these techniques, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Bayesian Networks (BNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Decision Trees (DTs) have been widely applied in cancer research for the development of predictive models, resulting in effective and accurate decision making. Even though it is evident that the use of ML methods can improve our understanding of cancer progression, an appropriate level of validation is needed in order for these methods to be considered in the everyday clinical practice. In this work, we present a review of recent ML approaches employed in the modeling of cancer progression. The predictive models discussed here are based on various supervised ML techniques as well as on different input features and data samples. Given the growing trend on the application of ML methods in cancer research, we present here the most recent publications that employ these techniques as an aim to model cancer risk or patient outcomes.},

Design, Setting, and Participants The Cluster Randomized Trial of PSA Testing for Prostate Cancer (CAP) included 419 582 men aged 50 to 69 years and was conducted at 573 primary care practices across the United Kingdom. Randomization and recruitment of the practices occurred between 2001 and 2009; patient follow-up ended on March 31, 2016. Intervention An invitation to attend a PSA testing clinic and receive a single PSA test vs standard (unscreened) practice. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcome: prostate cancer-specific mortality at a median follow-up of 10 years. Prespecified secondary outcomes: diagnostic cancer stage and Gleason grade (range, 2-10; higher scores indicate a poorer prognosis) of prostate cancers identified, all-cause mortality, and an instrumental variable analysis estimating the causal effect of attending the PSA screening clinic. Results Among 415 357 randomized men (mean [SD] age, 59.0 [5.6] years), 189 386 in the intervention group and 219 439 in the control group were included in the analysis (n = 408 825; 98%). In the intervention group, 75 707 (40%) attended the PSA testing clinic and 67 313 (36%) underwent PSA testing. Of 64 436 with a valid PSA test result, 6857 (11%) had a PSA level between 3 ng/mL and 19.9 ng/mL, of whom 5850 (85%) had a prostate biopsy. After a median follow-up of 10 years, 549 (0.30 per 1000 person-years) died of prostate cancer in the intervention group vs 647 (0.31 per 1000 person-years) in the control group (rate difference, -0.013 per 1000 person-years [95% CI, -0.047 to 0.022]; rate ratio [RR], 0.96 [95% CI, 0.85 to 1.08]; P = .50). The number diagnosed with prostate cancer was higher in the intervention group (n = 8054; 4.3%) than in the control group (n = 7853; 3.6%) (RR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.14 to 1.25]; P < .001). More prostate cancer tumors with a Gleason grade of 6 or lower were identified in the intervention group (n = 3263/189 386 [1.7%]) than in the control group (n = 2440/219 439 [1.1%]) (difference per 1000 men, 6.11 [95% CI, 5.38 to 6.84]; P < .001). In the analysis of all-cause mortality, there were 25 459 deaths in the intervention group vs 28 306 deaths in the control group (RR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.94 to 1.03]; P = .49). In the instrumental variable analysis for prostate cancer mortality, the adherence-adjusted causal RR was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.67 to 1.29; P = .66). Conclusions and Relevance Among practices randomized to a single PSA screening intervention vs standard practice without screening, there was no significant difference in prostate cancer mortality after a median follow-up of 10 years but the detection of low-risk prostate cancer cases increased. Although longer-term follow-up is under way, the findings do not support single PSA testing for population-based screening. Trial Registration ISRCTN Identifier: ISRCTN92187251.},

abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information tech-nology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biolo-gy, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the devel-opment of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting—the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression & path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for " wide " data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.},

Although the application of the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening test resulted in an increase in the PCa diagnosed cases, it demonstrated a negligible benefit regarding the associated mortality. Treatment options vary, with active surveillance to be preferable for patients with low-risk PCa and therapy of advanced castration-resistant PCa to rely on $\alpha$-emitters and cytotoxic chemotherapy. Although recent developments have led to the approval of novel drugs for the treatment of castration-resistant PCa, the optimal sequence and timing of medication have not been yet determined.

abstract = {Health status and outcomes are frequently measured on an ordinal scale. For high-throughput genomic datasets, the common approach to analyzing ordinal response data has been to break the problem into one or more dichotomous response analyses. This dichotomous response approach does not make use of all available data and therefore leads to loss of power and increases the number of type I errors. Herein we describe an innovative frequentist approach that combines two statistical techniques, L(1) penalization and continuation ratio models, for modeling an ordinal response using gene expression microarray data. We conducted a simulation study to assess the performance of two computational approaches and two model selection criteria for fitting frequentist L(1) penalized continuation ratio models. Moreover, we empirically compared the approaches using three application datasets, each of which seeks to classify an ordinal class using microarray gene expression data as the predictor variables. We conclude that the L(1) penalized constrained continuation ratio model is a useful approach for modeling an ordinal response for datasets where the number of covariates (p) exceeds the sample size (n) and the decision of whether to use Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for selecting the final model should depend upon the similarities between the pathologies underlying the disease states to be classified.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group Development and manufacture of nanomaterials is growing at an exponential rate, despite an incomplete understanding of how their physicochemical characteristics affect their potential toxicity. Redox activity has been suggested to be an important physicochemical property of nanomaterials to predict their biological activity. This study assessed the influence of redox activity by modification of cerium dioxide nanoparticles (CeO 2 NPs) via zirconium (Zr) doping on the biodistribution, pulmonary and cardiovascular effects in mice following inhalation. Healthy mice (C57BL/6 J), mice prone to cardiovascular disease (ApoE −/− , western-diet fed) and a mouse model of neurological disease (5 × FAD) were exposed via nose-only inhalation to CeO 2 NPs with varying amounts of Zr-doping (0%, 27% or 78% Zr), or clean air, over a four-week period (4 mg/m 3 for 3 h/day, 5 days/week). Effects were assessed four weeks post-exposure. In all three mouse models CeO 2 NP exposure had no major toxicological effects apart from some modest inflammatory histopathology in the lung, which was not related to the amount of Zr-doping. In ApoE −/− mice CeO 2 did not change the size of atherosclerotic plaques, but there was a trend towards increased inflammatory cell content in relation to the Zr content of the CeO 2 NPs. These findings show that subacute inhalation of CeO 2 NPs causes minimal pulmonary and cardiovascular effect four weeks post-exposure and that Zr-doping of CeO 2 NPs has limited effect on these responses. Further studies with nanomaterials with a higher inherent toxicity or a broader range of redox activities are needed to fully assess the influence of redox activity on the toxicity of nanomaterials.},

Recent genomic profiling studies have deeply improved the knowledge of the genomic landscape of localized and metastatic PCa. The AR and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways are the two most frequently altered, representing therefore interestingly targets for therapy. Moreover, somatic or germline aberrations of DNA repair genes (DRGs) have been observed at high frequency, supporting the potential role of platinum derivatives and PARP inhibitors as effective therapeutic strategies. In the future, the identification of driver mutations present at a specific stage of the disease, the classification PCa based on specific molecular alterations, and the selection of the most appropriate therapy based on biomarkers predictors of response represent the foundations for an increasingly more accurate personalized medicine."

abstract = {BACKGROUND The Oncotype DX Prostate Cancer Assay is a multi-gene RT-PCR expression assay that was developed for use with fixed paraffin-embedded (FPE) diagnostic prostate needle biopsies containing as little as 1 mm of prostate tumor in the greatest dimension. The assay measures expression of 12 cancer-related genes representing four biological pathways and 5 reference genes which are algorithmically combined to calculate the Genomic Prostate Score (GPS). This biopsy-based assay has been analytically and subsequently clinically validated as a predictor of aggressive prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to validate the analytical performance of the Oncotype DX Prostate Cancer Assay using predefined acceptance criteria. RESULTS The lowest quartile of RNA yields from prostate needle biopsies (six 5 $\mu$m sections) was between 19 and 34 ng. Analytical validation of the process requiring as little as 5 ng of RNA met all pre-defined acceptance criteria. Amplification efficiencies, analytical sensitivity, and accuracy of gene assays were measured by serially diluting an RNA sample and analyzing features of the linear regression between RNA expression measured by the crossing point (Cp) versus the log2 of the RNA input per PCR assay well. Gene assays were shown to accurately measure expression over a wide range of inputs (from as low as 0.005 ng to 320 ng). Analytical accuracy was excellent with average biases at qPCR inputs representative of patient samples <9.7% across all assays while amplification efficiencies were within ±6% of the median. Assessments of reproducibility and precision were performed by testing 10 prostate cancer RNA samples over multiple instruments, reagent lots, operators, days (precision), and RNA input levels (reproducibility) using appropriately parameterized linear mixed models. The standard deviations for analytical precision and reproducibility were 1.86 and 2.11 GPS units (100-unit scale) respectively. CONCLUSIONS The Oncotype DX Prostate Cancer Assay, a clinical RT-PCR assay specifically designed for use with prostate needle biopsies, has been analytically validated using very limited RNA inputs. The assay requirements and analytical performance will provide physicians with test results from a robust and reliable assay which will enable improved treatment decisions for men diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer.},

The almond moth, Cadra cautella, is double infected with two Wolbachia variants, wCauA and wCauB, and expresses complete cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). The individual contribution of wCauA and wCauB to the expression of CI are unclear, however, because the two variants have not been separated in this host. The effect of wCauA is of particular interest because it induces male killing when transferred into the Mediterranean flour moth, Ephestia kuehniella. In the present study, we generated C. cautella infected with only wCauA by treating double-infected insects with tetracycline. Single-infected C. cautella exhibited strong CI, demonstrating that wCauA induces two distinct reproductive phenotypes in different hosts: CI in C. cautella and male killing in E. kuehniella. CI was also observed in the cross of double-infected males and single-infected females. Comparison of the single- and double-infected insects by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction suggested that the wCauA density is not affected much by the presence or absence of wCauB.},

abstract = {Context Research has increased significantly on small vesicles secreted by healthy and diseased cells. Recent discoveries have revealed their functional and biomarker roles in urologic diseases. Whether and how this knowledge of extracellular vesicles (EVs) affects translational research and clinical practices have become pertinent questions. Objective To provide an overview of the currently available literature on the rising field of EVs, focusing on function and pathogenesis in urologic cancers and the usefulness of EVs as biomarkers. Evidence acquisition A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed to identify original articles, review articles, and editorials regarding EVs in different types of urologic tumor diseases. Articles published between 2005 and 2015 were reviewed and selected with the consensus of all authors. Evidence synthesis Besides soluble factors, different types of EVs are involved in the complex cross talk between different cell types. EVs regulate normal physiologic processes like spermatogenesis and renal function, as well as disease-specific processes including bladder, kidney, and prostate cancer. The content of EVs is derived from the cytoplasm of the donor cell. The proteins and RNAs within these EVs can be isolated from body fluids (eg, urine and blood) and represent potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. EVs are also candidate therapeutic targets and potentially useful as therapeutic vehicles. Conclusions The current data suggest that EVs are important regulators of cell–cell communication. The growing knowledge about their roles in urologic malignancies provides the basis for novel therapeutic strategies. In addition, nucleic acid and the protein content of EVs holds promise for the discovery of urine- or serum-based biomarkers for kidney, bladder, and prostate cancer. Patient summary Normal and cancer cells secrete small vesicles that contain proteins and RNAs from the cell of origin. Changes in the diseased cells can be detected by examining the altered content of these vesicles when secreted in body fluids, for example, blood and urine. The recently discovered roles of extracellular vesicles (EVs) provide new options to detect malignancy in the urine and blood. The uptake of EVs may be blocked therapeutically and thereby potentially impede cancer progression.},

The personalized-medicine approach to cancer management holds promise for earlier disease detection, accurate prediction of prognosis, and better treatment options; however, the early experience with personalized medicine has revealed important concerns that need to be addressed before research findings can be translated to the bedside.\n\nCONTENT: We discuss several emerging "practical" or "focused" applications of personalized medicine. Molecular testing can have an important positive impact on health and disease management in a number of ways, and the list of specific applications is evolving. This list includes improvements in risk assessment, disease prevention, identification of new disease-related mutations, accurate disease classification based on molecular signatures, selection of patients for enrollment in clinical trials, and development of new targeted therapies, especially for metastatic tumors that are refractory to treatment. Several challenges remain to be addressed before genomics information can be applied successfully in the routine clinical management of cancers. Further improvements and investigations are needed in data interpretation, extraction of actionable items, cost-effectiveness, how to account for patient heterogeneity and ethnic variation, and how to handle the risk of "incidental findings" in genetic testing.\n\nSUMMARY: It is now clear that personalized medicine will not immediately provide a permanent solution for patient management and that further refinement in the applications of personalized medicine will be needed to address and focus on specific issues.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1988 to 2002, 7,316 patients treated in the United States at 44 institutions with either surgery (n = 4,946) or radiation (n = 2,370) for clinical stage T1c-2, N0 or NX, M0 prostate cancer made up the study cohort. A Cox regression analysis was performed to determine the ability of pretreatment risk groups to predict time to PCSM after treatment. The relative risk (RR) of PCSM and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the intermediate- and high-risk groups relative to the low-risk group. RESULTS: Estimates of non-PCSM 8 years after prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure were 4% v 15% (surgery versus radiation; Plog rank =.002) compared with 13% v 18% (surgery versus radiation; Plog rank =.35) for patients whose age at the time of PSA failure was less than 70 as compared with >or= 70 years, respectively. The RR of PCSM after treatment for surgery-managed patients with high- or intermediate-risk disease was 14.2 (95% CI, 5.0 to 23.4; PCox <.0001) and 4.9 (95% CI, 1.7 to 8.1; PCox =.0037), respectively. These values were 14.3 (95% CI, 5.2 to 24.0; PCox <.0001) and 5.6 (95% CI, 2.0 to 9.3; PCox =.0012) for radiation-managed patients. CONCLUSION: This study provided evidence to support the prediction of time to PCSM after surgery or radiation on the basis of pretreatment risk groups for patients with clinically localized prostate cancer managed during the PSA era.},

abstract = {Background The European Randomised study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) has shown significant reductions in prostate cancer mortality after 9 years and 11 years of follow-up, but screening is controversial because of adverse events such as overdiagnosis. We provide updated results of mortality from prostate cancer with follow-up to 2010, with analyses truncated at 9, 11, and 13 years.\nMethods ERSPC is a multicentre, randomised trial with a predefined centralised database, analysis plan, and core age group (55-69 years), which assesses prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing in eight European countries. Eligible men aged 50-74 years were identified from population registries and randomly assigned by computer generated random numbers to screening or no intervention (control). Investigators were masked to group allocation. The primary outcome was prostate cancer mortality in the core age group. Analysis was by intention to treat. We did a secondary analysis that corrected for selection bias due to non-participation. Only incidence and no mortality data at 9 years' follow-up are reported for the French centres. This study is registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN49127736.\nFindings With data truncated at 13 years of follow-up, 7408 prostate cancer cases were diagnosed in the intervention group and 6107 cases in the control group. The rate ratio of prostate cancer incidence between the intervention and control groups was 1??91 (95% CI 1??83-1??99) after 9 years (1??64 [1??58-1??69] including France), 1??66 (1??60-1??73) after 11 years, and 1??57 (1??51-1??62) after 13 years. The rate ratio of prostate cancer mortality was 0??85 (0??70-1??03) after 9 years, 0??78 (0??66-0??91) after 11 years, and 0??79 (0??69-0??91) at 13 years. The absolute risk reduction of death from prostate cancer at 13 years was 0??11 per 1000 person-years or 1??28 per 1000 men randomised, which is equivalent to one prostate cancer death averted per 781 (95% CI 490-1929) men invited for screening or one per 27 (17-66) additional prostate cancer detected. After adjustment for non-participation, the rate ratio of prostate cancer mortality in men screened was 0??73 (95% CI 0??61-0??88).\nInterpretation In this update the ERSPC confirms a substantial reduction in prostate cancer mortality attributable to testing of PSA, with a substantially increased absolute effect at 13 years compared with findings after 9 and 11 years. Despite our findings, further quantification of harms and their reduction are still considered a prerequisite for the introduction of populated-based screening.\nFunding Each centre had its own funding responsibility.},

abstract = {Background Physicians report difficulty convincing patients with prostate cancer about the merits of active surveillance (AS); as a result, a majority of patients unnecessarily choose to undergo radical treatment. Objective To develop and evaluate a systematic approach for physicians to counsel patients with low-risk prostate cancer to increase acceptance of AS. Design, setting, and participants A systematic counseling approach was developed and piloted in one clinic. Then five surgeons participated in a 1-h training session in which they learned about the approach. A total of 1003 patients with Gleason 3 + 3 prostate cancer were included in the study. We compared AS rates for 761 patients who were counseled over a 24-mo period before the training intervention with AS rates for 242 patients who were counseled over a 12-mo period afterwards, controlling for temporal trends and case mix. Intervention A systematic approach for communicating the merits of AS using appropriate framing techniques derived from principles studied by negotiation scholars. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis The rate of AS acceptance by patients for management of low-risk prostate cancer. Results and limitations In the pilot phase, 81 of 86 patients (94%) accepted AS after counseling by the physician who developed the counseling approach. In the subsequent study, the cohort for the training intervention comprised 1003 consecutive patients, 80% of whom met the Epstein criteria for very low-risk disease. The proportion of patients who selected AS increased from 69% before the training intervention to 81% afterwards. After adjusting for time trends and case mix, the rate of AS after the intervention was 9.1% higher (95% confidence interval −0.4% to 19.4%) than expected, a relative reduction of approximately 30% in the risk of unnecessary curative treatment. Conclusions A systematic approach to counseling can be taught to physicians in a 1-h lecture. We found evidence that even this minimal intervention can decrease overtreatment. Our novel approach offers a framework to help address cancer screening–related overtreatment that occurs across medicine. Patient summary In this study, we evaluated the impact of teaching physicians how to better communicate the benefits and risks of prostate cancer treatments on the willingness of patients to choose active surveillance. Decisions related to cancer are often guided by emotions and biases that lead most patients to seek radical treatment; however, we demonstrated that if discussions are framed differently, these biases can be overcome and more patients will choose active surveillance.},

Tensor-Flow uses dataflow graphs to represent computation, shared state, and the operations that mutate that state. It maps the nodes of a dataflow graph across many machines in a cluster, and within a machine across multiple com-putational devices, including multicore CPUs, general-purpose GPUs, and custom-designed ASICs known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). This architecture gives flexibility to the application developer: whereas in previ-ous " parameter server " designs the management of shared state is built into the system, TensorFlow enables develop-ers to experiment with novel optimizations and training al-gorithms. TensorFlow supports a variety of applications, with a focus on training and inference on deep neural net-works. Several Google services use TensorFlow in pro-duction, we have released it as an open-source project, and it has become widely used for machine learning research. In this paper, we describe the TensorFlow dataflow model and demonstrate the compelling performance that Tensor-Flow achieves for several real-world applications.},

abstract = {In this article we introduce Random Survival Forests, an ensemble tree method for the analysis of right censored survival data. As is well known, con- structing ensembles frombase learners, such as trees, can significantly improve learning performance. Re- cently, Breiman showed that ensemble learning can be further improved by injecting randomization into the base learning process, a method called Random Forests (Breiman, 2001). Random Survival Forests is closely modeled after Breiman's approach. In Ran- dom Forests, randomization is introduced in two forms. First, a randomly drawn bootstrap sample of the data is used for growing the tree. Second, the tree learner is grown by splitting nodes on randomly se- lected predictors. While at first glance Random For- est might seem an unusual procedure, considerable empirical evidence has shown it to be highly effec- tive. Extensive experimentation, for example, has shown it compares favorably to state of the art en- sembles methods such as bagging (Breiman, 1996) and boosting (Schapire et al., 1998)},

abstract = {The prostate gland contains three major glandular regions--the peripheral zone, the central zone, and the transition zone--which differ histologically and biologically. The central zone is relatively resistant to carcinoma and other disease; the transition zone is the main site of origin of prostate hyperplasia. There are also several important nonglandular regions concentrated in the anteromedial portion of the gland. Each glandular zone has specific architectural and stromal features. In all zones, both ducts and acini are lined by secretory epithelium. In each zone, there is a layer of basal cells beneath the secretory lining, as well as interspersed endocrine-paracrine cells. Frequent deviations from normal histology include post-inflammatory atrophy, basal cell hyperplasia, benign nodular hyperplasia, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, and duct-acinar dysplasia. These lesions may at times be confused with carcinoma, especially in biopsy material.},

abstract = {Objectives: The prevalence of incidental prostatic adenocarcinoma (PCa) and its precursor, high grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) in an autopsy series from Hungarians (Central European Caucasians) was assessed and compared to similar data from the United States and European countries. Methods: Autopsy cases (n = 139; 18-95 years) with no history of urological disease were histologically examined for prostate cancer and HGPIN. After en block removal, the prostate glands were fixed in formalin, sectioned at 3-5 mm intervals and embedded in paraffin. Whole-mount serial sections were stained with Hematoxylin-eosin and examined for the presence of PCa and HGPIN. The frequency of PCa and HGPIN was compared to autopsy data obtained from other geographical areas. Results: We found a 38.8% prevalence of incidental PCa with increasing age-related incidence. Both PCa and HGPIN are first detected in the 3rd decade and show a steady increase with age with respect to number of foci, tumor grade and volume. In the age group 81-95, 86.6% and 60% of men had PCa and HGPIN, respectively. Conclusions: Incidental PCa and HGPIN are very prevalent in Hungarian population, comparable with the high US and the Scandinavian epidemiological data for Caucasians. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: New screening methods that can add predictive diagnostic value for aggressive (high-grade, Gleason score ⩾7) prostate cancer (PCa) are needed to reduce unnecessary biopsies for patients with non-aggressive PCa. This is particularly important for men presenting for an initial biopsy with an equivocal PSA in the 2-10 ng ml(-1) range. PCA3 and ERG are biomarkers that can add predictive value for PCa in urine; however, with a limited utility as a digital rectal exam (DRE) is required.\n\nMETHODS: First-catch urine samples were collected at six sites from men scheduled to undergo a prostate biopsy. Exosomal RNA was extracted, RNA copy numbers of ERG and PCA3 were measured by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and the EXO106 score (the sum of normalized PCA3 and ERG RNA levels) was computed. Performance was compared with standard of care (SOC; PSA, age, race or family history) parameters. Contingency table, logistic regression, receiver operating characteristics curve and box-plot analyses were performed.\n\nRESULTS: In this cohort (N=195), a dichotomous EXO106 score demonstrated good clinical performance in predicting biopsy result for both any cancer and high-grade disease. For high-grade disease, the negative and positive predictive values were 97.5% and 34.5%, respectively. The discrimination between high-grade and Gleason score ⩽6 (including benign) biopsy results by a combination of EXO106 and SOC (area under the curve (AUC)=0.803) was significantly improved compared with SOC without EXO106 (AUC=0.6723, P=0.0009). The median EXO106 score correlated (P<0.001; Spearman's rank order) with histologic grade.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: A novel molecular signature (EXO106 score) derived from non-DRE urine demonstrated independent, negative predictive value for the diagnosis of high-grade PCa from initial biopsy for men with 'gray zone' serum PSA levels. Its use in the biopsy decision process could result in fewer prostate biopsies for clinically insignificant disease.Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Disease advance online publication, 8 September 2015; doi:10.1038/pcan.2015.40.},

abstract = {We recently purified the rat liver hyaluronan receptor for endocytosis (HARE) and found abundant expression of 175- and approximately 300-kDa HARE species in sinusoidal endothelial cells of the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. We report herein the first cloning and functional expression of the rat 175-kDa HARE. Peptide sequences were obtained from the purified 175-kDa HARE, and degenerate oligonucleotide primers were designed for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and cDNA cloning. Results of 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, Northern analysis, N-terminal sequence, and antibody reactivity analyses indicated the absence of mRNA directly encoding the 175-kDa HARE. This protein is most likely derived from a larger precursor. Accordingly, we constructed an artificial 4.7-kb cDNA encoding the 1431 amino acid 175-kDa HARE. The predicted type I membrane protein has a mass of 156,393 Da and a pI of 7.86. The 175-kDa HARE cDNA, fused to the N-terminal leader sequence of the Ig kappa-chain, was transfected transiently into COS-7 cells and stably into SK-Hep-1 cells, respectively, to assess hyaluronan or hyaluronic acid (HA)-binding activity and endocytosis. In both cases, HARE expression and HA-binding activity were detected. Furthermore, stable SK-175HARE cells demonstrated specific endocytosis of (125)I-HA and receptor recycling. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis confirmed that recombinant HARE was expressed on the cell surface and that fluorescent HA uptake was inhibited by a specific blocking monoclonal antibody against HARE. Additionally, HARE was substantially colocalized with clathrin, but not with internalized HA that was delivered to lysosomes. The results confirm that recombinant 175-kDa HARE is an authentic endocytic receptor for HA and that this receptor can function independently of the approximately 300-kDa HARE. HARE is the first functionally identified member of a protein family that shares a similar organization of Fasciclin, epidermal growth factor-like, Xlink, and transmembrane domains.},

abstract = {Recent studies suggest that extracellular vesicles may be the key to timely diagnosis and monitoring of genito-urological malignancies. In this study we investigated the composition and content of extracellular vesicles found in the urine of healthy donors and prostate cancer patients. Urine of 14 PCa patients and 20 healthy volunteers was clarified by low-speed centrifugation and total extracellular vesicles fraction was obtain by high-speed centrifugation. The exosome-enriched fraction was obtained by filtration of total extracellular vesicles through a 0.1 mum pore filter. Transmission electron microscopy showed that cell-free urine in both groups contained vesicles from 20 to 230 nm. Immunogold staining after ultrafiltration demonstrated that 95% and 90% of extracellular vesicles in healthy individuals and cancer patients, respectively, were exosomes. Protein, DNA and RNA concentrations as well as size distribution of extracellular vesicles in both fractions were analyzed. Only 75% of the total protein content of extracellular vesicles was associated with exosomes which amounted to 90-95% of all vesicles. Median DNA concentrations in total extracellular vesicles and exosome-enriched fractions were 18 pg/ml and 2.6 pg/ml urine, correspondingly. Urine extracellular vesicles carried a population of RNA molecules 25 nt to 200 nt in concentration of no more than 290 pg/ml of urine. Additionally, concentrations of miR-19b, miR-25, miR-125b, and miR-205 were quantified by qRT-PCR. MiRNAs were shown to be differently distributed between different fractions of extracellular vesicles. Detection of miR-19b versus miR-16 in total vesicles and exosome-enriched fractions achieved 100%/93% and 95%/79% specificity/sensitivity in distinguishing cancer patients from healthy individuals, respectively, demonstrating the diagnostic value of urine extracellular vesicles.},

abstract = {Objective: Several nomograms have been developed to predict outcomes related to prostate cancer (PCa). Methods: We provide a descriptive and an analytic comparison of nomograms. Further, we report a set of recent PCa nomograms, in which we recorded predictor variables, number of patients used to develop each nomogram, and nomogram-specific features. Moreover, accuracy estimates and type of validation are considered. Results: Our findings suggest a demand for updated nomograms in selected fields of PCa outcomes. Moreover, an increasing number of nomograms address important end points such as prostate-specific antigen recurrence, distant metastases, or androgen-independent PCa-specific survival. Conclusion: Our results suggest that nomograms are available for many PCa-related outcomes. They represent a valid methodologic approach if correct criteria are met. {\textcopyright} 2006 European Association of Urology.},

abstract = {Decision trees are attractive classifiers due to their high execution speed. But trees derived with traditional methods often cannot be grown to arbitrary complexity for possible loss of generalization accuracy on unseen data. The limitation on complexity usually means suboptimal accuracy on training data. Following the principles of stochastic modeling, we propose a method to construct tree-based classifiers whose capacity can be arbitrarily expanded for increases in accuracy for both training and unseen data. The essence of the method is to build multiple trees in randomly selected subspaces of the feature space. Trees in, different subspaces generalize their classification in complementary ways, and their combined classification can be monotonically improved. The validity of the method is demonstrated through experiments on the recognition of handwritten digits},

abstract = {Objective To present a summary of the 2016 version of the European Association of Urology (EAU) - European Society for Radiotherapy & Oncology (ESTRO) - International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) Guidelines on screening, diagnosis, and local treatment with curative intent of clinically localised prostate cancer (PCa). Evidence acquisition The working panel performed a literature review of the new data (2013–2015). The guidelines were updated and the levels of evidence and/or grades of recommendation were added based on a systematic review of the evidence. Evidence synthesis BRCA2 mutations have been added as risk factors for early and aggressive disease. In addition to the Gleason score, the five-tier 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology grading system should now be provided. Systematic screening is still not recommended. Instead, an individual risk-adapted strategy following a detailed discussion and taking into account the patient's wishes and life expectancy must be considered. An early prostate-specific antigen test, the use of a risk calculator, or one of the promising biomarker tools are being investigated and might be able to limit the overdetection of insignificant PCa. Breaking the link between diagnosis and treatment may lower the overtreatment risk. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging using standardised reporting cannot replace systematic biopsy, but robustly nested within the diagnostic work-up, it has a key role in local staging. Active surveillance always needs to be discussed with very low-risk patients. The place of surgery in high-risk disease and the role of lymph node dissection have been clarified, as well as the management of node-positive patients. Radiation therapy using dose-escalated intensity-modulated technology is a key treatment modality with recent improvement in the outcome based on increased doses as well as combination with hormonal treatment. Moderate hypofractionation is safe and effective, but longer-term data are still lacking. Brachytherapy represents an effective way to increase the delivered dose. Focal therapy remains experimental while cryosurgery and HIFU are still lacking long-term convincing results. Conclusions The knowledge in the field of diagnosis, staging, and treatment of localised PCa is evolving rapidly. The 2016 EAU-ESTRO-SIOG Guidelines on PCa summarise the most recent findings and advice for the use in clinical practice. These are the first PCa guidelines endorsed by the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology and the International Society of Geriatric Oncology and reflect the multidisciplinary nature of PCa management. A full version is available from the EAU office and online (http://uroweb.org/guideline/prostate-cancer/). Patient summary The 2016 EAU-STRO-IOG Prostate Cancer (PCa) Guidelines present updated information on the diagnosis, and treatment of clinically localised prostate cancer. In Northern and Western Europe, the number of men diagnosed with PCa has been on the rise. This may be due to an increase in opportunistic screening, but other factors may also be involved (eg, diet, sexual behaviour, low exposure to ultraviolet radiation). We propose that men who are potential candidates for screening should be engaged in a discussion with their clinician (also involving their families and caregivers) so that an informed decision may be made as part of an individualised risk-adapted approach.},

Objective Validate logistic regression models, termed Mi-Prostate Score (MiPS), that incorporate serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA; or the multivariate Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial risk calculator version 1.0 [PCPTrc]) and urine T2:ERG and PCA3 scores for predicting PCa and high-grade PCa on biopsy. Design, setting, and participants T2:ERG and PCA3 scores were generated using clinical-grade transcription-mediated amplification assays. Pretrained MiPS models were applied to a validation cohort of whole urine samples prospectively collected after digital rectal examination from 1244 men presenting for biopsy. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Area under the curve (AUC) was used to compare the performance of serum PSA (or the PCPTrc) alone and MiPS models. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to assess clinical benefit. Results and limitations Among informative validation cohort samples (n = 1225 [98%], 80% from patients presenting for initial biopsy), models incorporating T2:ERG had significantly greater AUC than PSA (or PCPTrc) for predicting PCa (PSA: 0.693 vs 0.585; PCPTrc: 0.718 vs 0.639; both p < 0.001) or high-grade (Gleason score >6) PCa on biopsy (PSA: 0.729 vs 0.651, p < 0.001; PCPTrc: 0.754 vs 0.707, p = 0.006). MiPS models incorporating T2:ERG score had significantly greater AUC (all p < 0.001) than models incorporating only PCA3 plus PSA (or PCPTrc or high-grade cancer PCPTrc [PCPThg]). DCA demonstrated net benefit of the MiPS_PCPTrc (or MiPS_PCPThg) model compared with the PCPTrc (or PCPThg) across relevant threshold probabilities. Conclusions Incorporating urine T2:ERG and PCA3 scores improves the performance of serum PSA (or PCPTrc) for predicting PCa and high-grade PCa on biopsy.

abstract = {The advent of high throughput technologies has led to a wealth of publicly available biological data coming from different sources, the so-called 'omics data (transcriptomics for the study of transcripts, proteomics for proteins, metabolomics for metabolites, etc). Combining such large-scale biological data sets can lead to the discovery of important biological insights, provided that relevant information can be extracted in a holistic manner. Current statistical approaches have been focusing on identifying small subsets of molecules (a 'molecular signature') that explains or predicts biological conditions, but mainly for the analysis of a single data set. In addition, commonly used methods are univariate and consider each biological feature independently. In contrast, linear multivariate methods adopt a system biology approach by statistically integrating several data sets at once and offer an unprecedented opportunity to probe relationships between heterogeneous data sets measured at multiple functional levels. mixOmics is an R package which provides a wide range of linear multivariate methods for data exploration, integration, dimension reduction and visualisation of biological data sets. The methods we have developed extend Projection to Latent Structure (PLS) models for discriminant analysis and data integration and include l1 penalisations to identify molecular signatures. Here we introduce the mixOmics methods specifically developed to integrate large data sets, either at the N-level, where the same individuals are profiled using different 'omics platforms (same N), or at the P-level, where independent studies including different individuals are generated under similar biological conditions using the same 'omics platform (same P). In both cases, the main challenge to face is data heterogeneity, due to inherent platform-specific artefacts (N-integration), or systematic differences arising from experiments assayed at different geographical sites or different times (P-integration). We present and illustrate those novel multivariate methods on existing 'omics data available from the package.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of improving the accuracy of an hypothesis output by a learning algorithm in the distribution-free (PAC) learning model. A concept class is learnable (or strongly learnable) if, given access to a Source of examples of the unknown concept, the learner with high probability is able to output an hypothesis that is correct on all but an arbitrarily small fraction of the instances. The concept class is weakly learnable if the learner can produce an hypothesis that performs only slightly better than random guessing. In this paper, it is shown that these two notions of learnability are equivalent. A method is described for converting a weak learning algorithm into one that achieves arbitrarily high accuracy. This construction may have practical applications as a tool for efficiently converting a mediocre learning algorithm into one that performs extremely well. In addition, the construction has some interesting theoretical consequences, including a set of general upper bounds on the complexity of any strong learning algorithm as a function of the allowed error e.},

This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualise, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The authors previously developed and validated the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score to predict prostate cancer recurrence based on pretreatment clinical data. They aimed to develop a similar postsurgical score with improved accuracy via incorporation of pathologic data.\n\nMETHODS: A total of 3837 prostatectomy patients in the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE™) national disease registry were analyzed. Cox regression was used to determine the predictive power of preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA), pathologic Gleason score (pGS), surgical margins (SM), extracapsular extension (ECE), seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), and lymph node invasion (LNI). Points were assigned based on the relative weights of these variables in predicting recurrence. The new postsurgical score (CAPRA-S) was tested and compared with a commonly cited nomogram with proportional hazards analysis, concordance (c) index, calibration plots, and decision-curve analysis.\n\nRESULTS: Recurrence appeared in 16.8% of the men; actuarial progression-free probability at 5 years was 78.0%. The CAPRA-S was determined by adding up to 3 points for PSA, up to 3 points for pGS, 1 point each for ECE and LNI, and 2 points each for SM and SVI. The hazard ratio for each point increase in CAPRA-S score was 1.54 (95% confidence interval, 1.49-1.59), indicating a 2.4-fold increase in risk for each 2-point increase in score. The CAPRA-S c-index was 0.77, substantially higher than 0.66 for the pretreatment CAPRA score and comparable to 0.76 for the nomogram. The CAPRA-S score performed better in both calibration and decision curve analyses.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The CAPRA-S offers good discriminatory accuracy, calibration, and ease of calculation for clinical and research settings.},

abstract = {Background A disadvantage of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for the early detection of prostate cancer (PCa) is that many men must be screened, biopsied, and diagnosed to prevent one death. Objective To increase the specificity of screening for lethal PCa at an early stage. Design, setting, and participants We conducted a case-control study nested within a population-based cohort. PSA and three additional kallikreins were measured in cryopreserved blood from a population-based cohort in V{\"{a}}sterbotten, Sweden. Of 40 379 men providing blood at ages 40, 50, and 60 yr from 1986 to 2009, 12 542 men were followed for >15 yr. From this cohort, the Swedish Cancer Registry identified 1423 incident PCa cases, 235 with distant metastasis. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Risk of distant metastasis for different PSA levels and a prespecified statistical model based on the four kallikrein markers. Results and limitations Most metastatic cases occurred in men with PSA in the top quartile at age 50 yr (69%) or 60 yr (74%), whereas 20-yr risk of metastasis for men with PSA below median was low (≤0.6%). Among men with PSA >2 ng/ml, a prespecified model based on four kallikrein markers significantly enhanced the prediction of metastasis compared with PSA alone. About half of all men with PSA >2 ng/ml were defined as low risk by this model and had a ≤;1% 15-yr risk of metastasis. Conclusions Screening at ages 50-60 yr should focus on men with PSA in the top quartile. A marker panel can aid biopsy decision making. Patient summary For men in their fifties, screening should focus on those in the top 10% to 25% of PSA values because the majority of subsequent cases of distant metastasis are found among these men. Testing of four kallikrein markers in men with an elevated PSA could aid biopsy decision making.},

abstract = {Health status and outcomes are frequently measured on an ordinal scale. For high-throughput genomic datasets, the common approach to analyzing ordinal response data has been to break the problem into one or more dichotomous response analyses. This dichotomous response approach does not make use of all available data and therefore leads to loss of power and increases the number of type I errors. Herein we describe an innovative frequentist approach that combines two statistical techniques, L(1) penalization and continuation ratio models, for modeling an ordinal response using gene expression microarray data. We conducted a simulation study to assess the performance of two computational approaches and two model selection criteria for fitting frequentist L(1) penalized continuation ratio models. Moreover, we empirically compared the approaches using three application datasets, each of which seeks to classify an ordinal class using microarray gene expression data as the predictor variables. We conclude that the L(1) penalized constrained continuation ratio model is a useful approach for modeling an ordinal response for datasets where the number of covariates (p) exceeds the sample size (n) and the decision of whether to use Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for selecting the final model should depend upon the similarities between the pathologies underlying the disease states to be classified.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a heterogeneous class of lipid bound particles shed by any cell in the body in physiological and pathological conditions. EVs play critical functions in intercellular communication. EVs can actively travel in intercellular matrices and eventually reach the circulation. They can also be released directly in biological fluids where they appear to be stable. Because the molecular content of EVs reflects the composition of the cell of origin, they have recently emerged as a promising source of biomarkers in a number of diseases. EV analysis is particularly attractive in cancer patients that frequently present with increased numbers of circulating EVs. METHODS: We sought to review the current literature on the molecular profile of prostate cancer-derived EVs in model systems and patient biological fluids in an attempt to draw some practical and universal conclusions on the use of EVs as a tool for liquid biopsy in clinical specimens. RESULTS: We discuss advantages and limitations of EV-based liquid biopsy approaches summarizing salient studies on protein, DNA and RNA. Several candidate biomarkers have been identified so far but these results are difficult to apply to the clinic. However, the field is rapidly moving toward the implementation of novel tools to isolate cancer-specific EVs that are free of benign EVs and extra-vesicular contaminants. This can be achieved by identifying markers that are exquisitely present in tumor cell-derived EVs. An important contribution might also derive from a better understanding of EV types that may play specific functions in tumor progression and that may be a source of cancer-specific markers. CONCLUSIONS: EV analysis holds strong promises for the development of non-invasive biomarkers in patients with prostate cancer. Implementation of modern methods for EV isolation and characterization will enable to interrogate circulating EVs in vivo.Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases advance online publication, 4 April 2017; doi:10.1038/pcan.2017.7.},

@article{Gopalan2009,
abstract = {A significant number of prostate cancers have been shown to have recurrent chromosomal rearrangements resulting in the fusion of the androgen-regulated TMPRSS2 promoter to a member of the ETS transcription factor family, most commonly ERG. This results in ERG overexpression, which may have a direct causal role in prostate tumorigenesis or progression. However, the clinical significance of the rearrangement is unclear, and in particular, relationship to outcome has been inconsistent in recent reports. We analyzed TMPRSS2-ERG gene rearrangement status by fluorescence in situ hybridization in 521 cases of clinically localized surgically treated prostate cancer with 95 months of median follow-up and also in 40 unmatched metastases. Forty-two percent of primary tumors and 40% of metastases had rearrangements. Eleven percent had copy number increase (CNI) of the TMPRRS2-ERG region. Rearrangement alone was associated with lower grade, but not with stage, biochemical recurrence, metastases, or death. CNI with and without rearrangement was associated with high grade and advanced stage. Further, a subgroup of cancers with CNI and rearrangement by deletion, with two or more copies of the deleted locus, tended to be more clinically aggressive. DNA index assessment revealed that the majority of tumors with CNI of TMPRSS2-ERG had generalized aneuploidy/tetraploidy in contrast to tumors without TMPRSS2-ERG CNI, which were predominantly diploid. We therefore conclude that translocation of TMPRSS2-ERG is not associated with outcome, and the aggressive clinical features associated with CNI of chromosome 21 reflect generalized aneuploidy and are not due to CNI specifically of rearranged TMPRSS2-ERG.},

A number of “no free lunch” (NFL) theorems are presented which establish that for any algorithm, any elevated performance over one class of problems is offset by performance over another class. These theorems result in a geometric interpretation of what it means for an algorithm to be well suited to an optimization problem. Applications of the NFL theorems to information-theoretic aspects of optimization and benchmark measures of performance are also presented. Other issues addressed include time-varying optimization problems and a priori “head-to-head” minimax distinctions between optimization algorithms, distinctions that result despite the NFL theorems' enforcing of a type of uniformity over all algorithms},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of quantitative diffusion and perfusion parameters to aid in discriminating between transition zone carcinomas and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-four transition zone cancers and BPH nodules were contoured on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and raw dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI. Benign prostatic hyperplasia nodules were then stratified into 2 groups based on the presence or absence of a capsule. Apparent diffusion coefficient values, per-voxel Ktrans, kep, vp, and ve were all compared across all groups. RESULTS Average ADCs (×10 mm/s) were 1019.22, 1338.11, and 1272.46 for cancer, encapsulated BPH, and nonencapsulated BPH, respectively. Both subgroups of BPH were found to be significantly different than that of cancer (P < 0.05). No individual DCE-MRI parameter was significantly different between cancer and either BPH group. The area under the curve for ADC alone was 0.83, and no individual DCE imaging parameter improved the area under the curve of ADC. CONCLUSIONS Apparent diffusion coefficient may play a role in distinguishing TZ cancers from non-encapsulated BPH nodules that closely resemble cancer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence of carcinoma of the prostate gland (CaP) and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) was assessed in a Spanish population, representative of the Caucasian Mediterranean (CM) ethnic group. Data were compared with those described in populations from other geographical regions and in other ethnic groups.\n\nMETHODS: CaP and HGPIN were evaluated in a consecutive series of prostatic glands collected at the post-mortem examination of 162 male patients born and living in Spain, aged 20-80 years, and dying from trauma. The glands were sliced every 2-3 mm. All slices were paraffin embedded and sectioned to obtain 5 microm whole-mount sections. To compare the prevalence rate in our series and in other Caucasian populations with that from other geographical areas and other ethnic groups, we used data from the autopsy study performed at the Wayne State University.\n\nRESULTS: Prevalence of CaP is 3.58, 8.82, 14.28, 23.80, 31.7, and 33.33% in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th decades, respectively. The rates of HGPIN were 7.14, 11.75, 35.71, 38.06, 45.40, and 48.15% at the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 8th decades of life. Both CaP and HGPIN are located preferentially at the peripheral zone of the gland and in 21/27 cases (77.7%), an association between CaP and HGPIN was found. The prevalence of both lesions in CM males is significantly lower than in Caucasian American (CA) and Afro-American (AA) males in all the age groups evaluated.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Microscopic foci of CaP and HGPIN can be documented in CM males from the 3rd decade of life onwards. The lesions become more frequent and extensive as age increases. The prevalence of both lesions seems to be significantly lower in the CM population than in CA and AA males in all the age groups evaluated.},

@article{Lughezzani2010,
abstract = {Background: Several models can predict the rate of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP). Objective: We tested the three most commonly used models-the D'Amico risk stratification scheme, the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score, and the Stephenson nomogram-in a European cohort of RP patients. Design, setting, and participants: We relied on preoperative characteristics and prostate-specific antigen follow-up data of 1976 patients, as required by the three tested models. All patients were treated with an open RP between 1992 and 2006. Measurements: Analyses included tests of accuracy (Harrell's concordance index) and calibration between predicted and observed BCR rates at 3 yr and 5 yr after RP. Additionally, we relied on decision curve analyses to compare the three models directly in a head-to-head fashion. Results and limitations: The median follow-up of censored patients was 32 mo. BCR-free rates at 3 yr and 5 yr after RP were 80.2% and 72.6%, respectively. The concordance index for 3-yr BCR predictions was 70.4%, 74.3%, and 75.2% for the D'Amico, CAPRA, and Stephenson models, respectively, versus 67.4%, 72.9%, and 73.5% for 5-yr BCR predictions. Calibration results supported the use of either the CAPRA or Stephenson models. Decision curve analyses indicated a small benefit for the CAPRA score relative to the Stephenson nomogram. Our findings apply to German patients treated with RP at a high-volume tertiary care centre. Consequently, the rank order reported in this paper may not be the same in North American or other European cohorts. Conclusions: Different methods yield different results, and it may be difficult to reconcile concordance index, calibration, and decision curve analysis findings. Our data suggest that the CAPRA score outperforms the other models when decision curve analysis and calibration were used as benchmarks. Conversely, the Stephenson nomogram outperformed the other models when concordance index was used as a metric. Crown Copyright {\textcopyright} 2009.},

In this review, we focus on those biomarkers that have been translated into commercial tests available to clinicians. Since these tests aim to fill specific gaps during the decision-making process of PCa management, we have grouped them based on the clinical question they claim to address, that is, improved PCa screening, false-negative biopsy dilemma, prognostic tests following a positive biopsy and tests predicting relapse/metastases after surgery. We evaluate each test with respect to its development, platform, clinical validation, biomatrix, regulatory approval status and cost.},

abstract = {Prostate cancer is a very complex disease, and the decision-making process requires the clinician to balance clinical benefits, life expectancy, comorbidities and potential treatment-related side effects. Accurate prediction of clinical outcomes may help in the difficult process of making decisions related to prostate cancer. In this review, we discuss attributes of predictive tools and systematically review those available for prostate cancer. Types of tools include probability formulas, look-up and propensity scoring tables, risk-class stratification prediction tools, classification and regression tree analysis, nomograms and artificial neural networks. Criteria to evaluate tools include discrimination, calibration, generalizability, level of complexity, decision analysis and ability to account for competing risks and conditional probabilities. The available predictive tools and their features, with a focus on nomograms, are described. While some tools are well-calibrated, few have been externally validated or directly compared with other tools. In addition, the clinical consequences of applying predictive tools need thorough assessment. Nevertheless, predictive tools can facilitate medical decision-making by showing patients tailored predictions of their outcomes with various alternatives. Additionally, accurate tools may improve clinical trial design.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: With recognition of the efficacy of surgical therapy for prostate cancer, there has been a marked increase in the number of radical prostatectomies performed, and substantial changes in surgical technique and perioperative management have decreased the morbidity of this procedure. We assessed the rate of perioperative complications with time and the risk factors for these complications, particularly age, operative time and co-morbidity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A detailed review of all medical records of a consecutive series of 472 patients treated with radical retropubic prostatectomy by 1 surgeon between 1990 and 1994 was performed to document any complication within 30 days postoperatively. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification recorded by the staff anesthesiologist was used as a standard index of co-morbidity. RESULTS: Major complications were identified in 46 patients (9.8%), minor complications in 101 (21.4%) and none in 341 (72.2%). There were 2 deaths (0.42%). Major complications were not associated with age, operative time or year of operation but were significantly associated with ASA class (p = 0.006) and operative blood loss (p = 0.015) in a logistic regression analysis. Only 16% of patients were assigned to ASA class 3, yet this group included both deaths, a 3-fold increase in major complications, prolonged hospital stay, greater need for intensive care unit admission and more frequent blood transfusions. Major complications were almost 3 times more frequent in class 3 (21.3%) than in class 1 or 2 (7.6%) cases (p <0.005). Minor complications significantly increased hospital stay by a mean of 26% and major complications by 47% (p <0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Radical retropubic prostatectomy was performed with no perioperative complication in 72% of patients. Major complications resulted in more intensive use of medical resources and were related to co-morbidity rather than age.},

Treatment was recommended for PSA velocity (PSAV) >1 ng/ml per year or adverse histology, defined as GS ≥4 + 3 or PPC >50%. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Outcomes described, using Kaplan-Meier methods, were rate of adverse histology on repeat biopsy, freedom from treatment, biochemical control after deferred treatment, and overall survival. Analyses using Cox regression were performed to determine predictors of deferred treatment and adverse histology. Results and limitations: The study enrolled 471 eligible patients from 2002 to 2011. Median age was 66 yr and median initial PSA value was 6.4 ng/ml. Eighty-eight percent of patients had T1 disease and 93% had GS ≤3 + 3. At median follow-up of 5.7 yr, the 5-yr rate of adverse histology and treatment-free probability was 22% (95% confidence interval [CI], 16-29%) and 70% (95% CI, 65-75%), respectively. There were two deaths from prostate cancer. Predictors of time to adverse histology were GS 7, PSAV >1 ng/ml per year, low ratio of free PSA to total PSA, and PPC >25%. Longer follow-up is needed to confirm the safety of this strategy. Conclusions: This study demonstrates satisfactory medium-term outcomes for AS in selected men with localised prostate cancer. {\textcopyright} 2013 European Association of Urology.},

abstract = {Context Although prostate cancer (PCa) screening reduces the incidence of advanced disease and mortality, trade-offs include overdiagnosis and resultant overtreatment. Objective To review primary data on PCa overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Evidence acquisition Electronic searches were conducted in Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, and Embase from inception to July 2013 for original articles on PCa overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Supplemental articles were identified through hand searches. Evidence synthesis The lead-time and excess-incidence approaches are the main ways used to estimate overdiagnosis in epidemiological studies, with estimates varying widely. The estimated number of PCa cases needed to be diagnosed to save a life has ranged from 48 down to 5 with increasing follow-up. In clinical studies, generally lower rates of overdiagnosis have been reported based on the frequency of low-grade minimal tumors at radical prostatectomy (1.7-46.8%). Autopsy studies have reported PCa in 18.5-38.5%, although not all are low grade or low volume. Factors influencing overdiagnosis include the study population, screening protocol, and background incidence, limiting generalizability between settings. Reported rates of overtreatment vary widely in the literature, although contemporary international studies suggest increasing use of conservative management. Conclusions Epidemiological, clinical, and autopsy studies have been used to examine PCa overdiagnosis, with estimates ranging widely from 1.7% to 67%. Correspondingly, estimates of overtreatment vary widely based on patient features and may be declining internationally. Careful patient selection for screening and reducing overtreatment are important to preserve the benefits and reduce the downstream harms of prostate-specific antigen testing. Because all of these estimates are extremely population and context specific, this must be considered when using these data to inform policy. Patient summary Screening reduces spread and death from prostate cancer (PCa) but overdiagnoses some low-risk tumors that may not have caused harm. Because treatment has potential side effects, it is critical that not all patients with PCa receive aggressive treatment. ?? 2013 European Association of Urology.},

abstract = {Background Despite revisions in 2005 and 2014, the Gleason prostate cancer (PCa) grading system still has major deficiencies. Combining of Gleason scores into a three-tiered grouping (6, 7, 8-10) is used most frequently for prognostic and therapeutic purposes. The lowest score, assigned 6, may be misunderstood as a cancer in the middle of the grading scale, and 3 + 4 = 7 and 4 + 3 = 7 are often considered the same prognostic group. Objective To verify that a new grading system accurately produces a smaller number of grades with the most significant prognostic differences, using multi-institutional and multimodal therapy data. Design, setting, and participants Between 2005 and 2014, 20 845 consecutive men were treated by radical prostatectomy at five academic institutions; 5501 men were treated with radiotherapy at two academic institutions. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Outcome was based on biochemical recurrence (BCR). The log-rank test assessed univariable differences in BCR by Gleason score. Separate univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards used four possible categorizations of Gleason scores. Results and limitations In the surgery cohort, we found large differences in recurrence rates between both Gleason 3 + 4 versus 4 + 3 and Gleason 8 versus 9. The hazard ratios relative to Gleason score 6 were 1.9, 5.1, 8.0, and 11.7 for Gleason scores 3 + 4, 4 + 3, 8, and 9-10, respectively. These differences were attenuated in the radiotherapy cohort as a whole due to increased adjuvant or neoadjuvant hormones for patients with high-grade disease but were clearly seen in patients undergoing radiotherapy only. A five-grade group system had the highest prognostic discrimination for all cohorts on both univariable and multivariable analysis. The major limitation was the unavoidable use of prostate-specific antigen BCR as an end point as opposed to cancer-related death. Conclusions The new PCa grading system has these benefits: more accurate grade stratification than current systems, simplified grading system of five grades, and lowest grade is 1, as opposed to 6, with the potential to reduce overtreatment of PCa. Patient summary We looked at outcomes for prostate cancer (PCa) treated with radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy and validated a new grading system with more accurate grade stratification than current systems, including a simplified grading system of five grades and a lowest grade is 1, as opposed to 6, with the potential to reduce overtreatment of PCa.},

abstract = {Background—Diagnostic and prognostic models are typically evaluated with measures of accuracy that do not address clinical consequences. Decision-analytic techniques allow assessment of clinical outcomes, but often require collection of additional information, and may be cumbersome to apply to models that yield a continuous result. We sought a method for evaluating and comparing prediction models that incorporates clinical consequences, requires only the dataset on which the models are tested, and can be applied to models that have either continuous or dichotomous results. Method—We describe decision curve analysis, a simple, novel method of evaluating predictive models. We start by assuming that the threshold probability of a disease or event at which a patient would opt for treatment is informative of how the patient weighs the relative harms of a false-positive and a false-negative prediction. This theoretical relationship is then used to derive the net benefit of the model across different threshold probabilities. Plotting net benefit against threshold probability yields the “decision curve”. We apply the method to models for the prediction of seminal vesicle invasion in prostate cancer patients. Decision curve analysis identified the range of threshold probabilities in which a model was of value, the magnitude of benefit, and which of several models was optimal. Conclusion—Decision curve analysis is a suitable method for evaluating alternative diagnostic and prognostic strategies that has advantages over other commonly used measures and techniques.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The natural history of prostate cancer is highly variable and it is difficult to predict. We showed previously that a cell cycle progression (CCP) score was a robust predictor of outcome in a conservatively managed cohort diagnosed by transurethral resection of the prostate. A greater need is to predict outcome in patients diagnosed by needle biopsy.\n\nMETHODS: Total RNA was extracted from paraffin specimens. A CCP score was calculated from expression levels of 31 genes. Clinical variables consisted of centrally re-reviewed Gleason score, baseline prostate-specific antigen level, age, clinical stage, and extent of disease. The primary endpoint was death from prostate cancer.\n\nRESULTS: In univariate analysis (n=349), the hazard ratio (HR) for death from prostate cancer was 2.02 (95% CI (1.62, 2.53), P<10(-9)) for a one-unit increase in CCP score. The CCP score was only weakly correlated with standard prognostic factors and in a multivariate analysis, CCP score dominated (HR for one-unit increase=1.65, 95% CI (1.31, 2.09), P=3 × 10(-5)), with Gleason score (P=5 × 10(-4)) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (P=0.017) providing significant additional contributions.\n\nCONCLUSION: For conservatively managed patients, the CCP score is the strongest independent predictor of cancer death outcome yet described and may prove valuable in managing clinically localised prostate cancer.},

Objective To validate published ccRCC prognostic biomarkers in an independent patient cohort and to assess intratumour heterogeneity (ITH) of the most promising markers to guide biomarker optimisation. Design, setting, and participants Cancer-specific survival (CSS) for each of 28 identified genetic or transcriptomic biomarkers was assessed in 350 ccRCC patients. ITH was interrogated in a multiregion biopsy data set of 10 ccRCCs. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Biomarker association with CSS was analysed by univariate and multivariate analyses. Results and limitations A total of 17 of 28 biomarkers (TP53 mutations; amplifications of chromosomes 8q, 12, 20q11.21q13.32, and 20 and deletions of 4p, 9p, 9p21.3p24.1, and 22q; low EDNRB and TSPAN7 expression and six gene expression signatures) were validated as predictors of poor CSS in univariate analysis. Tumour stage and the ccB expression signature were the only independent predictors in multivariate analysis. ITH of the ccB signature was identified in 8 of 10 tumours. Several genetic alterations that were significant in univariate analysis were enriched, and chromosomal instability indices were increased in samples expressing the ccB signature. The study may be underpowered to validate low-prevalence biomarkers. Conclusions The ccB signature was the only independent prognostic biomarker. Enrichment of multiple poor prognosis genetic alterations in ccB samples indicated that several events may be required to establish this aggressive phenotype, catalysed in some tumours by chromosomal instability. Multiregion assessment may improve the precision of this biomarker. Patient summary We evaluated the ability of published biomarkers to predict the survival of patients with clear cell kidney cancer in an independent patient cohort. Only one molecular test adds prognostic information to routine clinical assessments. This marker showed good and poor prognosis results within most individual cancers. Future biomarkers need to consider variation within tumours to improve accuracy.},

There is an unmet clinical need for noninvasive, easy to administer, diagnostic assays to help assess whether a prostate biopsy is warranted. OBJECTIVE To determine the performance of a novel urine exosome gene expression assay (the ExoDx Prostate IntelliScore urine exosome assay) plus standard of care (SOC) (ie, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level, age, race, and family history) vs SOC alone for discriminating between Gleason score (GS)7 and GS6 and benign disease on initial biopsy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In training, using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we compared the urine exosome gene expression assay with biopsy outcomes in 499 patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of 2 to20 ng/mL.

Ongoing controversy exists about the most appropriate system of tumor classification and grading and the optimal curative treatment approaches. This review examines recent progress in the pathogenesis of multifocal prostatic adenocarcinoma and its biologic, pathologic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications. Prostatic cancer multifocality makes accurate clinical staging difficult, and repeated revisions have been undertaken in an effort to optimize prognostic accuracy. Although the 2010 revision represents an improvement over the previous systems, the clinical significance of the T2 substaging is questionable. Also discussed is the potential impact of tumor multifocality and clonal heterogeneity on the oncologic efficacy of novel focal ablative approaches. The clinical significance of smaller secondary tumors and the relationship between extent of chromosomal abnormalities and the metastatic potential of an individual tumor focus were reviewed. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {UNLABELLED: What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Prognostic tools, such as the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score and the 1998 Kattan and 2006 Stephenson nomograms, predicting biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy are widely used for treatment decision making and counselling patients. However, tools derived in certain cohorts tend to perform less well when they are applied to populations that are dissimilar in terms of population or disease characteristics, health systems or treatment practices. Some of the loss in accuracy of a prognostic tool is a consequence of unknown factors and hence the performance of a tool when applied to a different population is unknown and largely unpredictable. This study validates these widely used tools in South Australian patients treated at three public hospitals. All three tools discriminated well according to risk of recurrence in these patients. However, when compared against observed rates of recurrence, it was found that predictions of recurrence varied widely between the three tools, suggesting that their use in counselling patients on such risk may not be appropriate. Interestingly, the oldest of the three tools (Kattan 1998) was the best predictor of absolute risk of recurrence. In the paper, this is linked to later adoption of updated Gleason grading, among other factors.\n\nSUMMARY: In many countries, prognostic tools, which draw on the experience of thousands of patients with cancer, are used to predict cancer outcomes, but accuracy varies. This paper compares the accuracy of three widely used tools predicting prostate cancer recurrence after surgery in Australian patients. The results show that all tools were good at predicting which patients were most likely to experience recurrence and which were least. However, prediction of absolute risk varied and the oldest tool was the most accurate.\n\nOBJECTIVE: • To compare performance of the CAPRA score and two commonly used risk assessment nomograms, the 1998 Kattan and the 2006 Stephenson, in an untested Australian cohort.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: • We present data on 635 men from the South Australian Prostate Cancer Clinical Outcomes Database who underwent radical prostatectomy between January 1996 and May 2009 and had all required variables for predicting biochemical recurrence (BCR). • BCR was defined as prostate-specific antigen ≥ 0.2 ng/mL or secondary treatment for a rising prostate-specific antigen. • Accuracy was evaluated using Harrell's concordance index, plotting calibration curves, and constructing decision analysis curves.\n\nRESULTS: • Concordance indices were high for all three tools: 0.791, 0.787 and 0.744 for the 2006 Stephenson nomogram, CAPRA score and 1998 Kattan nomogram respectively. • At 3 years, calibration of the tools (agreement between predicted and observed BCR-free probability) was close to ideal for the 1998 Kattan nomogram, whereas the 2006 Stephenson model underestimated and the CAPRA model overestimated BCR-free probability. • The 1998 Kattan and 2005 CAPRA tools performed better than the 2006 Stephenson nomogram across a wide range of threshold probabilities using decision curve analysis.\n\nCONCLUSION: • All three tools discriminate between patients' risk effectively. • Absolute estimates of risk are likely to vary widely between tools, however, suggesting that models should be validated and, if necessary, recalibrated in the population to which they will be applied. • Recent development does not mean a nomogram is more accurate for use in a particular population.},

abstract = {Early detection is the key to effective treatment of prostate cancer, and to the prevention of deaths due to progression to untreatable advanced stage cancer. Because of mitigating factors, especially benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), that result in a low accuracy (about 60%) of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, there is an urgent need for a more reliable biomarker for the identification of early stage through advanced stage prostate cancer and 'at-risk' individuals. To address this issue we propose that changes in prostatic fluid composition could provide accurate and reliable biomarkers for the screening of prostate cancer. Most notable is the consistent and significant decrease in citrate and zinc that is associated with the development and progression of prostate cancer. In this review we provide the clinical and physiological basis and the evidence in support of the utility of prostatic fluid analysis as an effective approach for screening/detection of prostate cancer, especially early stage and 'at-risk' subjects. The problem of BPH interference that plagues PSA testing is eliminated in the potential prostatic fluid biomarkers. The potential development of rapid, simple, direct, accurate clinical tests provides additional advantageous conditions. Further exploration and development of citrate, zinc and other electrolytes as prostatic fluid biomarkers are urgently needed to address this critical prostate cancer issue.},

A remarkable feature of these molecular signatures is that they have few genes in common, prompting speculation that they may use distinct genes to measure the same pathophysiological process(es), such as proliferation. However, this supposition has not been rigorously tested. If gene-based classifiers function by measuring a minimal number of cellular processes, we hypothesized that the informative genes for these processes could be identified and the data sets could be adjusted for the predictive contributions of those genes. Such adjustment would then attenuate the predictive function of any signature measuring that same process.},

abstract = {Cancers emerge from an ongoing Darwinian evolutionary process, often leading to multiple competing subclones within a single primary tumour. This evolutionary process culminates in the formation of metastases, which is the cause of 90% of cancer-related deaths. However, despite its clinical importance, little is known about the principles governing the dissemination of cancer cells to distant organs. Although the hypothesis that each metastasis originates from a single tumour cell is generally supported, recent studies using mouse models of cancer demonstrated the existence of polyclonal seeding from and interclonal cooperation between multiple subclones. Here we sought definitive evidence for the existence of polyclonal seeding in human malignancy and to establish the clonal relationship among different metastases in the context of androgen-deprived metastatic prostate cancer. Using whole-genome sequencing, we characterized multiple metastases arising from prostate tumours in ten patients. Integrated analyses of subclonal architecture revealed the patterns of metastatic spread in unprecedented detail. Metastasis-to-metastasis spread was found to be common, either through de novo monoclonal seeding of daughter metastases or, in five cases, through the transfer of multiple tumour clones between metastatic sites. Lesions affecting tumour suppressor genes usually occur as single events, whereas mutations in genes involved in androgen receptor signalling commonly involve multiple, convergent events in different metastases. Our results elucidate in detail the complex patterns of metastatic spread and further our understanding of the development of resistance to androgen-deprivation therapy in prostate cancer.},

abstract = {Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been the mainstay of treatment for advanced prostate cancer for decades, and has been shown to control disease and improve symptoms. In addition, for men with high-risk localized or locally advanced prostate cancer, short-course ADT in combination with radiotherapy improves survival. There is evidence that ADT increases cardiovascular risk, particularly in men with preexisting cardiovascular disease. This increased risk may apply even with short-course ADT. In an individual patient, the benefits of ADT should be balanced against the risk, and patients who require ADT should have risk factors for cardiovascular disease optimized. There is some evidence to suggest that more contemporary methods of delivering ADT may reduce cardiovascular risk. One of the key drivers of prostate cancer is the androgen testosterone. The production of testosterone primarily occurs in the testes, and this process is regulated by luteiniz-ing hormone (LH) produced by the anterior pituitary gland. In turn, the production of LH is regulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) (also called luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [LHRH]), produced by the hypothalamus. Testosterone acts as a " negative feedback " to maintain physiological levels; high levels of tes-tosterone will lead to inhibition of GnRH and LH production, reducing subsequent testosterone production. Manipulating the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis to achieve castrate levels of testosterone is a key therapeutic intervention in men with advanced prostate cancer. However, the testes produce only 90% of the testosterone present in the adult male. The remaining 10% is derived from adrenal steroid synthesis. The adrenal glands secrete the weak androgens dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione that can be converted into testosterone in peripheral tissues and the prostate gland. Newer hormone treatments have been developed to target the production of androgen precursors in the adrenal gland, and have shown to be effective in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Despite the undoubted benefit of lowering testosterone in men with advanced prostate cancer, there may be unwanted side effects as these hormones have other physiological roles in the body. The potential consequences of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) are described in this review.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND. It remains unclear whether the Prostate Health Index (PHI) or the urinary Prostate-Cancer Antigen 3 (PCA-3) score is more accurate at screening for prostate cancer (PCa). The aim of this study was to prospectively compare the accuracy of PHI and PCA-3 scores to predict overall and significant PCa in men undergoing an initial prostate biopsy. METHODS. Double-blind assessments of PHI and PCA-3 were conducted by referent physicians in 138 patients who subsequently underwent trans-rectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy according to a 12-core scheme. Predictive accuracies of PHI and PCA-3 were assessed using AUC and compared according to the DeLong method. Diagnostic perform- ances with usual cut-off values for positivity (i.e., PHI >40 and PCA-3 >35) were calculated, and odds ratios associated with predicting PCa overall and significant PCa as defined by pathological updated Epstein criteria (i.e., Gleason score ?7, more than three positive cores, or >50% cancer involvement in any core) were estimated using logistic regression. RESULTS. Prevalences of overall and significant PCa were 44.9% and 28.3%, respectively. PCA-3 (AUC¼0.71) was the most accurate predictor of PCa overall, and significantly outperformed PHI (AUC¼0.65; P¼0.03). However, PHI (AUC¼0.80) remained the most accurate predictor when screening exclusively for significant PCa and significantly out- performed PCA-3 (AUC¼0.55; P¼0.03). Furthermore, PCA-3 >35 had the best accuracy, and positive or negative predictive values when screening for PCa overall whereas these diagnostic performances were greater for PHI >40 when exclusively screening for significant PCa. PHI>40 combined with PCA-3>35 was more specific in both cases. In multivariate analyses, PCA-3 >35 (OR¼5.68; 95%CI¼[2.21–14.59]; P<0.001) was significantly correlated with the presence of PCa overall, but PHI >40 (OR¼9.60; 95%CI¼[1.72–91.32]; P¼0.001) was the only independent predictor for detecting significant PCa. CONCLUSIONS.

abstract = {The prediction of the values of ordinal response variables using co-variate data is a relatively infrequent task in many application areas. Accordingly, ordinal response variables have gained comparably little attention in the literature on statistical prediction modeling. The random forest method is one of the strongest prediction methods for binary response variables and continuous response variables. Its basic, tree-based concept has led to several extensions including prediction methods for other types of response variables. In this paper, the ordinal forest method is introduced, a random forest based prediction method for ordinal response variables. Ordinal forests allow prediction using both low-dimensional and high-dimensional covariate data and can additionally be used to rank co-variates with respect to their importance for prediction. Using several real datasets and simulated data, the performance of ordinal forests with respect to prediction and covariate importance ranking is compared to competing approaches. First, these investigations reveal that ordinal forests tend to outperform competitors in terms of prediction performance. Second, it is seen that the covariate importance measure currently used by ordinal forest discriminates influential covariates from noise covariates at least similarly well as the measures used by competitors. In an additional investigation using simulated data, several further important properties of the OF algorithm are studied. The rationale underlying ordinal forests to use optimized score values in place of the class values of the ordinal response variable is in principle applicable to any regression method beyond random forests for continuous outcome that is considered in the ordinal forest method.},

abstract = {Like any other medical technology or intervention, diagnostic tests should be thoroughly evaluated before their introduction into daily practice. Increasingly, decision makers, physicians, and other users of diagnostic tests request more than simple measures of a test's analytical or technical performance and diagnostic accuracy; they would also like to see testing lead to health benefits. In this last article of our series, we introduce the notion of clinical utility, which expresses--preferably in a quantitative form--to what extent diagnostic testing improves health outcomes relative to the current best alternative, which could be some other form of testing or no testing at all. In most cases, diagnostic tests improve patient outcomes by providing information that can be used to identify patients who will benefit from helpful downstream management actions, such as effective treatment in individuals with positive test results and no treatment for those with negative results. We describe how comparative randomized clinical trials can be used to estimate clinical utility. We contrast the definition of clinical utility with that of the personal utility of tests and markers. We show how diagnostic accuracy can be linked to clinical utility through an appropriate definition of the target condition in diagnostic-accuracy studies.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION Prostate cancer is the most prevalent malignant neoplasia among men worldwide. Several prognostic factors, including Gleason's score, the measurement of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and the evaluation of the percentage of fragments affected by cancer on prostate biopsy, have already been established. Age alone, however, has yet to be studied as a prognostic factor independently from other known factors. The aim of the present study was to compare the characteristics and the evolution of prostate cancer in different age groups using a paired analysis for patients with equivalent known prognostic factors. In addition, we aimed to determine the true impact of age on the prognosis of prostate cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS The data from 2,283 patients subjected to radical retropubic prostatectomy between 1998 and 2009 were reviewed. The patients were divided into three age groups: < 55 years old, between 56 and 65 and > 65 years old. Each patient was matched to another patient in the other groups who had the same PSA range (< 4.0, between 4.0 and 10.0 and > 10), Gleason score on the surgical specimen and prognostic range of positive fragments in the prostate biopsy (< 33%, between 34 and 50% and > 50%). After pairing, each group consisted of 215 patients, who were compared using the biochemical recurrence of the disease (PSA > 0.2), the interval for biochemical relapse, extra-capsular invasion and invasion of the seminal vesicles or the lymph nodes. RESULTS. No significant difference was observed between the groups regarding the frequency of relapses, interval of relapse, extra-capsular invasion and invasion of the seminal vesicles or lymph nodes. DISCUSSION None of the studied factors were affected by the age of the patients. Therefore, patients of different ages had tumors with similar characteristics and behaviors. CONCLUSION When assessed separately, without the effects of the main prognostic factors, age does not appear to be an independent prognostic factor for prostate cancer.},

abstract = {Context: Although progress has been made with regard to types of markers (protein, DNA, RNA, and metabolites) and implementation of improved technologies (mass spectrometry, arrays, and deep sequencing), the discovery of novel biomarkers for prostate cancer (PCa) in complex fluids, such as serum and urine, remains a challenge. Meanwhile, recent studies have reported that many cancer-derived proteins and RNAs are secreted through small vesicles known as exosomes. Objective: This narrative review describes recent progress in exosome research, focusing on the potential role of exosomes as novel biomarkers for PCa. The purpose of this review is to acquaint clinicians and researchers in the field of urology with the potential role of exosomes as biomarker treasure chests and with their clinical value. Evidence acquisition: Medline and Embase entries between 1966 and September 2010 were searched using the keywords exosomes, microvesicles, prostasomes, biomarkers, prostate cancer, and urology. Leading publications and articles constructively contributing to exosome research were selected for this review. Evidence synthesis: Exosomes are small vesicles (50-100 nm) secreted by almost all tissues; they represent their tissue origin. Purification of prostate- and PCa-derived exosomes will allow us to profile exosomes, providing a promising source of protein and RNA biomarkers for PCa. This profiling will contribute to the discovery of novel markers for the early diagnosis and reliable prognosis of PCa. Conclusions: Although the initial results are promising, further investigations are required to assess the clinical value of these exosomes in PCa. {\textcopyright} 2010 European Association of Urology.},

The clinical usage of docetaxel has resulted in modest gains in survival, primarily due to the development of resistance. There are currently no clinical biomarkers available that predict whether a CRPC patient will respond or acquire resistance to this therapy. Comparative proteomics analysis of exosomes secreted from DU145 prostate cancer cells that are sensitive (DU145 Tax-Sen) or have acquired resistance (DU145 Tax-Res) to docetaxel, demonstrated significant differences in the amount of exosomes secreted and in their molecular composition. A panel of proteins was identified by proteomics to be differentially enriched in DU145 Tax-Res compared to DU145 Tax-Sen exosomes and was validated by western blotting. Importantly, we identified MDR-1, MDR-3, Endophilin-A2 and PABP4 that were enriched only in DU145 Tax-Res exosomes. We validated the presence of these proteins in the serum of a small cohort of patients. DU145 cells that have uptaken DU145 Tax-Res exosomes show properties of increased matrix degradation. In summary, exosomes derived from DU145 Tax-Res cells may be a valuable source of biomarkers for response to therapy.},

abstract = {Context Many men with clinically localized prostate cancer are being monitored as part of active surveillance (AS) programs, but little is known about reasons for receiving radical treatment. Objectives A systematic review of the evidence about AS was undertaken, with a meta-analysis to identify predictors of radical treatment. Evidence acquisition A comprehensive search of the Embase, MEDLINE and Web of Knowledge databases to March 2014 was performed. Studies reporting on men with localized prostate cancer followed by AS or monitoring were included. AS was defined where objective eligibility criteria, management strategies, and triggers for clinical review or radical treatment were reported. Evidence synthesis The 26 AS cohorts included 7627 men, with a median follow-up of 3.5 yr (range of medians 1.5-7.5 yr). The cohorts had a wide range of inclusion criteria, monitoring protocols, and triggers for radical treatment. There were eight prostate cancer deaths and five cases of metastases in 24 981 person-years of follow-up. Each year, 8.8% of men (95% confidence interval 6.7-11.0%) received radical treatment, most commonly because of biopsy findings, prostate-specific antigen triggers, or patient choice driven by anxiety. Studies in which most men changed treatment were those including only low-risk Gleason score 6 disease and scheduled rebiopsies. Conclusions The wide variety of AS protocols and lack of robust evidence make firm conclusions difficult. Currently, patients and clinicians have to make judgments about the balance of risks and benefits in AS protocols. The publication of robust evidence from randomized trials and longer-term follow-up of cohorts is urgently required. Patient summary We reviewed 26 studies of men on active surveillance for prostate cancer. There was evidence that studies including men with the lowest risk disease and scheduled rebiopsy had higher rates of radical treatment.},

Multiple aspects can be assessed in circulating cell-free DNA, including cell-free DNA levels, integrity, methylation and mutations. Other prospective liquid biopsy markers include circulating tumor cells, circulating RNAs (miRNA, lncRNAs and mRNAs), cell-free proteins, peptides and exosomes have also emerged as non-invasive cancer biomarkers. These circulating molecules can be detected in various biological fluids, including blood, urine, saliva and seminal plasma. Liquid biopsies hold great promise for personalized medicine due to their ability to provide multiple non-invasive global snapshots of the primary and metastatic tumors. Molecular profiling of circulating molecules has been a stepping-stone to the successful introduction of several non-invasive multi-marker tests into the clinic. In this review, we provide an overview of the current state of cell-free DNA-based kidney, prostate and bladder cancer biomarker research and discuss the potential utility other circulating molecules.

abstract = {Background: Understanding the heterogeneous genotypes and phenotypes of prostate cancer is fundamental to improving the way we treat this disease. As yet, there are no validated descriptions of prostate cancer subgroups derived from integrated genomics linked with clinical outcome. Methods: In a study of 482 tumour, benign and germline samples from 259 men with primary prostate cancer, we used integrative analysis of copy number alterations (CNA) and array transcriptomics to identify genomic loci that affect expression levels of mRNA in an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) approach, to stratify patients into subgroups that we then associated with future clinical behaviour, and compared with either CNA or transcriptomics alone. Findings: We identified five separate patient subgroups with distinct genomic alterations and expression profiles based on 100 discriminating genes in our separate discovery and validation sets of 125 and 103 men. These subgroups were able to consistently predict biochemical relapse (p = 0.0017 and p = 0.016 respectively) and were further validated in a third cohort with long-term follow-up (p = 0.027). We show the relative contributions of gene expression and copy number data on phenotype, and demonstrate the improved power gained from integrative analyses. We confirm alterations in six genes previously associated with prostate cancer ( MAP3K7, MELK, RCBTB2, ELAC2, TPD52, ZBTB4), and also identify 94 genes not previously linked to prostate cancer progression that would not have been detected using either transcript or copy number data alone. We confirm a number of previously published molecular changes associated with high risk disease, including MYC amplification, and NKX3-1, RB1 and PTEN deletions, as well as over-expression of PCA3 and AMACR, and loss of MSMB in tumour tissue. A subset of the 100 genes outperforms established clinical predictors of poor prognosis (PSA, Gleason score), as well as previously published gene signatures (p = 0.0001). We further show how our molecular profiles can be used for the early detection of aggressive cases in a clinical setting, and inform treatment decisions. Interpretation: For the first time in prostate cancer this study demonstrates the importance of integrated genomic analyses incorporating both benign and tumour tissue data in identifying molecular alterations leading to the generation of robust gene sets that are predictive of clinical outcome in independent patient cohorts.},

abstract = {Objective. —To determine whether prostate-specific antigen (PSA)—based screening alters the proportion of organ-confined prostate cancers detected. Design. —A prospective, nonrandomized, serial PSA-based screening trial (follow-up from 6 to 37 months), and a concurrent comparison group. Setting. —Genera community outpatient screening program based at a university center. Patients. —The study group consisted of 10251 men aged 50 years and older (mean and median age, 63 years; mean and median age of patients who underwent biopsies, 66 years) who presented to a prostate cancer screening program and consented to phlebotomy. The comparison group consisted of 266 concurrently studied private patients in the same age range (mean and median age, 68 years) who were referred for prostatic ultrasonography and biopsy because of an abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE). Main Outcome Measure. —Proportion detected with clinically or pathologically advanced prostate cancer. Results. —The men were divided into three groups: the comparison group, the initial PSA-based screening group, and the serial PSA-based screening group. The proportions of prostate cancers detected that were clinically or pathologically advanced were as follows: comparison group, 57% (27/47); initial PSA-based screening group, 37% (91/244); and serial PSA-based screening group, 29% (37/ 129). Screened patients had a lower proportion of advanced cancers than the comparison group ($\chi$2[2]=12.3;P=.002); this advantage was observed principally in patients younger than 70 years. Surgical staging revealed that the cancer was microscopically focal and well differentiated (possibly latent cancer) in 2.5% (1/40) of the nonscreened group, 2.9% (7/244) of the initially screened group, and 7.8% (10/129) of the serially screened group (generalized Fisher's Exact Test,P=.08). Conclusion. —Screening based on PSA identifies some men with prostate cancer who have a significantly increased proportion of organ-confined tumors compared with those detected through evaluation for an abnormal DRE alone.

abstract = {Background: Optimum management of clinically localised prostate cancer presents unique challenges because of the highly variable and often indolent natural history of the disease. To predict disease aggressiveness, clinicians combine clinical variables to create prognostic models, but the models have limited accuracy. We assessed the prognostic value of a predefined cell cycle progression (CCP) score in two cohorts of patients with prostate cancer. Methods: We measured the expression of 31 genes involved in CCP with quantitative RT-PCR on RNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour samples, and created a predefined score and assessed its usefulness in the prediction of disease outcome. The signature was assessed retrospectively in a cohort of patients from the USA who had undergone radical prostatectomy, and in a cohort of randomly selected men with clinically localised prostate cancer diagnosed by use of a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in the UK who were managed conservatively. The primary endpoint was time to biochemical recurrence for the cohort of patients who had radical prostatectomy, and time to death from prostate cancer for the TURP cohort. Findings: After prostatectomy, the CCP score was useful for predicting biochemical recurrence in the univariate analysis (hazard ratio for a 1-unit change [doubling] in CCP 1{\textperiodcentered}89; 95% CI 1{\textperiodcentered}54-2{\textperiodcentered}31; p=5{\textperiodcentered}6×10-9) and the best multivariate analysis (1{\textperiodcentered}77, 1{\textperiodcentered}40-2{\textperiodcentered}22; p=4{\textperiodcentered}3×10-6). In the best predictive model (final multivariate analysis), the CCP score and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration were the most important variables and were more significant than any other clinical variable. In the TURP cohort, the CCP score was the most important variable for prediction of time to death from prostate cancer in both univariate analysis (2{\textperiodcentered}92, 2{\textperiodcentered}38-3{\textperiodcentered}57, p=6{\textperiodcentered}1×10-22) and the final multivariate analysis (2{\textperiodcentered}57, 1{\textperiodcentered}93-3{\textperiodcentered}43; p=8{\textperiodcentered}2×10-11), and was stronger than all other prognostic factors, although PSA concentration also added useful information. Heterogeneity in the hazard ratio for the CCP score was not noted in any case for any clinical variables. Interpretation: The results of this study provide strong evidence that the CCP score is a robust prognostic marker, which, after additional validation, could have an essential role in determining the appropriate treatment for patients with prostate cancer.

abstract = {We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

abstract = {Prostate cancer incidence and mortality in most native Asian populations have gradually increased, but are around one-third lower than in corresponding Asian-American cohorts, which are themselves lower than the rates observed in other American cohorts. Although genetic and environmental factors, particularly a Western diet, could partially explain these differences, lower exposure to PSA screening in Asian individuals might be a major contributing factor. Genetic features and diet are, however, unlikely to differ substantially within the same region of Asia, and age-stratified PSA levels in men from various Asian countries are almost identical; therefore, variation in the epidemiology of prostate cancer among native Asian populations might be attributable to differences in access to PSA testing, urology clinics, and available therapies. Conversely, the proportion of patients with metastatic prostate cancer is substantially higher even in the more developed Asian countries than in migratory Asian populations residing in Western countries and in Westerners. Consequently, the most appropriate approaches to the management of prostate cancer in Asian countries probably also differ, and therefore individualized prostate cancer screening and treatment strategies based on the epidemiological features and socioeconomic status of each country are needed.},

abstract = {Objective To present a summary of the 2016 version of the European Association of Urology (EAU) – European Society for Radiotherapy & Oncology (ESTRO) – International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) Guidelines on the treatment of relapsing, metastatic, and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Evidence acquisition The working panel performed a literature review of the new data (2013–2015). The guidelines were updated, and the levels of evidence and/or grades of recommendation were added based on a systematic review of the literature. Evidence synthesis Relapse after local therapy is defined by a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level >0.2 ng/ml following radical prostatectomy (RP) and >2 ng/ml above the nadir after radiation therapy (RT). 11C-choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography is of limited importance if PSA is <1.0 ng/ml; bone scans and computed tomography can be omitted unless PSA is >10 ng/ml. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and biopsy are important to assess biochemical failure following RT. Therapy for PSA relapse after RP includes salvage RT at PSA levels <0.5 ng/ml and salvage RP, high-intensity focused ultrasound, cryosurgical ablation or salvage brachytherapy of the prostate in radiation failures. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) remains the basis for treatment of men with metastatic prostate cancer (PCa). However, docetaxel combined with ADT should be considered the standard of care for men with metastases at first presentation, provided they are fit enough to receive the drug. Follow-up of ADT should include analysis of PSA, testosterone levels, and screening for cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. Level 1 evidence for the treatment of metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) includes, abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (AA/P), enzalutamide, radium 223 (Ra 223), docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 every 3 wk and sipuleucel-T. Cabazitaxel, AA/P, enzalutamide, and radium are approved for second-line treatment of CRPC following docetaxel. Zoledronic acid and denosumab can be used in men with mCRPC and osseous metastases to prevent skeletal-related complications. Conclusions The knowledge in the field of advanced and metastatic PCa and CRPC is changing rapidly. The 2016 EAU-ESTRO-SIOG Guidelines on PCa summarise the most recent findings and advice for use in clinical practice. These PCa guidelines are the first endorsed by the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology and the International Society of Geriatric Oncology and reflect the multidisciplinary nature of PCa management. A full version is available from the EAU office or online (http://uroweb.org/guideline/prostate-cancer/). Patient summary In men with a rise in their PSA levels after prior local treatment for prostate cancer only, it is important to balance overtreatment against further progression of the disease since survival and quality of life may never be affected in many of these patients. For patients diagnosed with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, several new drugs have become available which may provide a clear survival benefit but the optimal choice will have to be made on an individual basis.},

abstract = {Cancer has been characterized as a heterogeneous disease consisting of many different subtypes. The early diagnosis and prognosis of a cancer type have become a necessity in cancer research, as it can facilitate the subsequent clinical management of patients. The importance of classifying cancer patients into high or low risk groups has led many research teams, from the biomedical and the bioinformatics field, to study the application of machine learning (ML) methods. Therefore, these techniques have been utilized as an aim to model the progression and treatment of cancerous conditions. In addition, the ability of ML tools to detect key features from complex datasets reveals their importance. A variety of these techniques, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Bayesian Networks (BNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Decision Trees (DTs) have been widely applied in cancer research for the development of predictive models, resulting in effective and accurate decision making. Even though it is evident that the use of ML methods can improve our understanding of cancer progression, an appropriate level of validation is needed in order for these methods to be considered in the everyday clinical practice. In this work, we present a review of recent ML approaches employed in the modeling of cancer progression. The predictive models discussed here are based on various supervised ML techniques as well as on different input features and data samples. Given the growing trend on the application of ML methods in cancer research, we present here the most recent publications that employ these techniques as an aim to model cancer risk or patient outcomes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify the clinical characteristics of anterior prostate cancers (APCs) and to compare these with posterior prostate cancers (PPCs).\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed 1290 consecutive open and laparoscopic radical prostatectomies (RPs) at the authors' institution from January 2000 to March 2004. Prostates were processed using a whole-mount technique. Each surgical specimen was reviewed by one pathologist, and tumour areas were marked, measured and mapped. Positive surgical margins (PSMs) were defined as the presence of cancer cells at the inked surface of the specimen. Specimens were then categorized by the location of their dominant tumour, i.e. pure anterior, anterior > posterior, posterior > anterior, or pure posterior. We compared the clinical and pathological characteristics of 259 patients in the pure-anterior group with the 594 in the pure-posterior group.\n\nRESULTS: Before RP, APCs had a significantly lower biopsy Gleason score (78% vs 68% with Gleason 4-6), fewer mean biopsy cores positive (2.0 vs 2.6), a smaller median percentage of positive cores (17% vs 26%), lower clinical stage (T1 in 79% vs 62%), and higher progression-free probability estimated by preoperative nomogram (86% vs 84%) than PPCs. Patients with APCs also had more previous negative biopsy sessions. The pathological analysis of RP specimens showed that those with APCs had higher tumour volume (1.6 vs 0.83 mL) and had a higher PSM rate (12% vs 7%) than those with PPCs, despite specimens with PPCs having higher rates of extraprostatic extension (10% vs 19%).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: APCs have lower Gleason grade and lower rates of extraprostatic extension, yet patients with anterior tumours have higher overall tumour volumes and higher PSM rates. Because current tools for detecting and staging prostate cancer can underestimate the extent of anterior prostate disease, improved methods are needed for localizing and characterizing anterior cancers.},

The anterior and apical aspects of the prostate were among the most common cancer locations. TTMB provides a high rate of cancer detection as initial and repeat biopsy. TTMB was particularly effective at diagnosing anterior and apical cancer. TTMB may have particular application for men considering active surveillance, with prior negative TRUS biopsies, and those considering subtotal gland or other minimally invasive treatments.},

abstract = {In biological fluids nanoparticles bind a range of molecules, particularly proteins, on their surface. The resulting protein corona influences biological activity and fate of nanoparticle in vivo. Corona composition is often determined by the biological milieu encountered at the entry portal into the body, and, can therefore, depend on the route of exposure to the nanoparticle. For environmental nanoparticles where exposure is by inhalation, this will be lung lining fluid. This study examined plasma and bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) protein binding to engineered and environmental nanoparticles. We hypothesized that protein corona on nanoparticles would influence nanoparticle uptake and subsequent pro-inflammatory biological response in macrophages. All nanoparticles bound plasma and BALF proteins, but the profile of bound proteins varied between nanoparticles. Focusing on diesel exhaust nanoparticles (DENP), we identified proteins bound from plasma to include fibrinogen, and those bound from BALF to include albumin and surfactant proteins A and D. The presence on DENP of a plasma-derived corona or one of purified fibrinogen failed to evoke an inflammatory response in macrophages. However, coronae formed in BALF increased DENP uptake into macrophages two fold, and increased nanoparticulate carbon black (NanoCB) uptake fivefold. Furthermore, a BALF-derived corona increased IL-8 release from macrophages in response to DENP from 1720 ± 850 pg/mL to 5560 ± 1380 pg/mL (p = 0.014). These results demonstrate that the unique protein corona formed on nanoparticles plays an important role in determining biological reactivity and fate of nanoparticle in vivo. Importantly, these findings have implications for the mechanism of detrimental properties of environmental nanoparticles since the principle route of exposure to such particles is via the lung.},

The summary presented represents Part I of the two-part series dedicated to Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer: AUA/ASTRO/SUO Guideline discussing risk stratification and care options by cancer severity. Materials and Methods: The systematic review utilized in the creation of this guideline was completed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and through additional supplementation by ECRI Institute. This review included articles published between January 2007 and March 2014 with an update search conducted through August 2016. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence for a particular treatment was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low) for support of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. Additional information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions ( in supplementary unabridged guideline, http://jurology.com/). Results: The AUA (American Urological Association), ASTRO, and SUO (Society of Urologic Oncology) formulated an evidence-based guideline based on a risk stratified clinical framework for the management of localized prostate cancer. Conclusions: This guideline attempts to improve a clinician's ability to treat patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer, but higher quality evidence in future trials will be essential to improve the level of care for these patients. In all cases, patient preferences should be considered when choosing a management strategy.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: We updated a long-term cancer control outcome in a large anatomical radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) series. We also evaluated the perioperative parameters that predict cancer specific outcomes following surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From May 1983 to February 2003, 1 surgeon (WJC) performed RRP in 3,478 consecutive men. Patients were followed with semiannual serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) tests and annual digital rectal examinations. We used Kaplan-Meier product limit estimates to calculate actuarial 10-year probabilities of biochemical progression-free survival, cancer specific survival and overall survival. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine independent perioperative predictors of cancer progression. RESULTS: At a mean followup of 65 months (range 0 to 233) actuarial 10-year biochemical progression-free, cancer specific and overall survival probabilities were 68%, 97% and 83%, respectively. On multivariate analysis biochemical progression-free survival probability was significantly associated with preoperative PSA, clinical tumor stage, Gleason sum, pathological stage and treatment era. Cancer specific survival and overall survival rates were also significantly associated with clinicopathological parameters. CONCLUSIONS: RRP can be performed with excellent survival outcomes. Favorable clinicopathological parameters and treatment in the PSA era are associated with improved cancer control.},

Similarly, of 262 patients diagnosed with Gleason 3 + 4 = 7 prostate cancer on initial biopsy, 60 (22.9%) were upgraded to Gleason score 4 + 3 = 7 or higher. • Tumours upgraded from Gleason 6 to 7 had a significantly lower index tumour volume (1.73 vs 2 mL, P= 0.029), higher calculated prostate volume (41.6 vs 39 mL, P= 0.017) and lower relative percentage of tumour to benign glandular tissue (4.3% vs 5.9%, P= 0.001) than tumours concordant for the higher grade. • Similarly, tumours that were Gleason score 3 + 4 on biopsy and upgraded on final pathology to 4 + 3 were significantly smaller as measured by both total tumour volume (2.3 vs 3.3 mL, P= 0.005) and index tumour volume (2.2 vs 3, P= 0.027) and occupied a smaller percentage of the gland volume (6.3% vs 8.9%, P= 0.017) compared with tumours concordant for the higher grade. • On multivariate analysis, lower prostate weight (hazard ratio 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.96-0.99, P < 0.001) and larger total tumour volume (hazard ratio 1.87, 95% confidence interval 1.4-2.6, P < 0.001) independently predicted an upgrade in Gleason score from 6 to 7. In tumours upgraded from biopsy Gleason 3 + 4, only higher index tumour volume (hazard ratio 3.1, 95% confidence interval 1.01-9.3, P= 0.048) was a significant predictor of upgrading on multivariate analysis.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: • Under-graded tumours are significantly smaller than tumours concordant for the higher grade, indicating that incomplete tumour sampling plays a significant role in Gleason score assignment error. • Surrogate measures of tumour volume may predict those at greatest risk of Gleason score upgrade.},

abstract = {Background Prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) and v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog (TMPRSS2-ERG) gene fusions are promising prostate cancer (PCa) specific biomarkers that can be measured in urine. Objective To evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of Progensa PCA3 and TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusions (as individual biomarkers and as a panel) for PCa in a prospective multicentre setting. Design, setting, and participants At six centres, post-digital rectal examination first-catch urine specimens prior to prostate biopsies were prospectively collected from 497 men. We assessed the predictive value of Progensa PCA3 and TMPRSS2-ERG (quantitative nucleic acid amplification assay to detect TMPRSS2-ERG messenger RNA [mRNA]) for PCa, Gleason score, clinical tumour stage, and PCa significance (individually and as a marker panel). This was compared with serum prostate-specific antigen and the European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) risk calculator. In a subgroup (n = 61) we evaluated biomarker association with prostatectomy outcome. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis and receiver operating curves were used. Results and limitations Urine samples of 443 men contained sufficient mRNA for marker analysis. PCa was diagnosed in 196 of 443 men. Both PCA3 and TMPRSS2-ERG had significant additional predictive value to the ERSPC risk calculator parameters in multivariate analysis (p < 0.001 and resp. p = 0.002). The area under the curve (AUC) increased from 0.799 (ERSPC risk calculator), to 0.833 (ERSPC risk calculator plus PCA3), to 0.842 (ERSPC risk calculator plus PCA3 plus TMPRSS2-ERG) to predict PCa. Sensitivity of PCA3 increased from 68% to 76% when combined with TMPRSS2-ERG. TMPRSS2-ERG added significant predictive value to the ERSPC risk calculator to predict biopsy Gleason score (p < 0.001) and clinical tumour stage (p = 0.023), whereas PCA3 did not. Conclusions TMPRSS2-ERG had independent additional predictive value to PCA3 and the ERSPC risk calculator parameters for predicting PCa. TMPRSS2-ERG had prognostic value, whereas PCA3 did not. Implementing the novel urinary biomarker panel PCA3 and TMPRSS2-ERG into clinical practice would lead to a considerable reduction of the number of prostate biopsies. {\textcopyright} 2012 European Association of Urology.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The time by which prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening advances prostate cancer diagnosis, called the lead time, has been reported by several studies, but results have varied widely, with mean lead times ranging from 3 to 12 years. A quantity that is closely linked with the lead time is the overdiagnosis frequency, which is the fraction of screen-detected cancers that would not have been diagnosed in the absence of screening. Reported overdiagnosis estimates have also been variable, ranging from 25% to greater than 80% of screen-detected cancers. METHODS: We used three independently developed mathematical models of prostate cancer progression and detection that were calibrated to incidence data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program to estimate lead times and the fraction of overdiagnosed cancers due to PSA screening among US men aged 54-80 years in 1985-2000. Lead times were estimated by use of three definitions. We also compared US and earlier estimates from the Rotterdam section of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) that were calculated by use of a microsimulation screening analysis (MISCAN) model. RESULTS: The models yielded similar estimates for each definition of lead time, but estimates differed across definitions. Among screen-detected cancers that would have been diagnosed in the patients' lifetimes, the estimated mean lead time ranged from 5.4 to 6.9 years across models, and overdiagnosis ranged from 23% to 42% of all screen-detected cancers. The original MISCAN model fitted to ERSPC Rotterdam data predicted a mean lead time of 7.9 years and an overdiagnosis estimate of 66%; in the model that was calibrated to the US data, these were 6.9 years and 42%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The precise definition and the population used to estimate lead time and overdiagnosis can be important drivers of study results and should be clearly specified.},

RE: Lead times; this could be a bonus and a drawback. If we can detect very aggressive (think DESNT) cancers well in advance, then we have the potential to stop death. However, if we also pick up more indolent diseases then we run into the same caveats as PSA screening.},

abstract = {Regularization techniques such as the lasso (Tibshirani 1996) and elastic net (Zou and Hastie 2005) can be used to improve regression model coefficient estimation and prediction accuracy, as well as to perform variable selection. Ordinal regression models are widely used in applications where the use of regularization could be beneficial; however, these models are not included in many popular software packages for regularized regression. We propose a coordinate descent algorithm to fit a broad class of ordinal regression models with an elastic net penalty. Furthermore, we demonstrate that each model in this class generalizes to a more flexible form, for instance to accommodate unordered categorical data. We introduce an elastic net penalty class that applies to both model forms. Additionally, this penalty can be used to shrink a non-ordinal model toward its ordinal counterpart. Finally, we introduce the R package ordinalNet, which implements the algorithm for this model class.},

It comprises not only neoplastic cells, but also other resident cells within the milieu such as stroma and vascular cells in addition to a variable cellular infiltrate from the periphery. A host of soluble factors such as growth factors, chemokines, eicosanoids soluble metabolites and extracellular matrix components have been extensively documented as factors which modulate this environment. However, in recent years there has also been growing interests in the potential roles of extracellular vesicles (EV) in many of the processes governing the nature of cancerous tissue. In this brief review, we have assembled evidence describing several distinct functions for extracellular vesicles in modulating the microenvironment with examples that include immune evasion, angiogenesis and stromal activation. Whilst there remains a great deal to be learnt about the interplay between vesicles and the cancerous environment, it is becoming clear that vesicle-mediated communication has a major influence on key aspects of cancer growth and progression. We conclude that the design of future therapeutics should acknowledge the existence and roles of extracellular vesicles, and seriously consider strategies for circumventing their effects in vivo.},

abstract = {Removal of, or adjustment for, batch effects or center differences is generally required when such effects are present in data. In particular, when preparing microarray gene expression data from multiple cohorts, array platforms, or batches for later analyses, batch effects can have confounding effects, inducing spurious differences between study groups. Many methods and tools exist for removing batch effects from data. However, when study groups are not evenly distributed across batches, actual group differences may induce apparent batch differences, in which case batch adjustments may bias, usually deflate, group differences. Some tools therefore have the option of preserving the difference between study groups, e.g. using a two-way ANOVA model to simultaneously estimate both group and batch effects. Unfortunately, this approach may systematically induce incorrect group differences in downstream analyses when groups are distributed between the batches in an unbalanced manner. The scientific community seems to be largely unaware of how this approach may lead to false discoveries.},

abstract = {Widespread prostate-specific antigen (PSA) -based screening and aggressive treatment of prostate cancer have reduced mortality rates substantially, but both remain controversial in large part because of high rates of overdiagnosis and overtreatment of otherwise indolent tumors. Active surveillance--or close monitoring of PSA levels combined with periodic imaging and repeat biopsies--is gaining acceptance as an alternative initial management strategy for men with low-risk prostate cancer. In reported series, rates of progression to active treatment with intermediate-term follow-up have ranged from 14% to 41%, and likelihood of subsequent cure with surgery or radiation does not seem to be compromised by an initial trial of surveillance. Two related challenges to broader acceptance of surveillance are better characterization at time of diagnosis of the risk of progression (including likelihood that given tumor may have been undersampled by diagnostic biopsy) and validation of optimal end points once surveillance begins. Both are subjects of intense ongoing investigation, with emerging biomarkers and novel imaging tests expected to facilitate decision making substantially. Recent reports have suggested active surveillance can be a cost-effective approach and preserve quality of life, but these questions must be assessed more definitively in prospective cohorts. Ultimately, by minimizing the harms of overtreating low-risk prostate cancer, active surveillance may help settle the controversy surrounding prostate cancer screening and management.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer was initiated in the early 1990s to evaluate the effect of screening with prostate-specific-antigen (PSA) testing on death rates from prostate cancer. METHODS: We identified 182,000 men between the ages of 50 and 74 years through registries in seven European countries for inclusion in our study. The men were randomly assigned to a group that was offered PSA screening at an average of once every 4 years or to a control group that did not receive such screening. The predefined core age group for this study included 162,243 men between the ages of 55 and 69 years. The primary outcome was the rate of death from prostate cancer. Mortality follow-up was identical for the two study groups and ended on December 31, 2006. RESULTS: In the screening group, 82% of men accepted at least one offer of screening. During a median follow-up of 9 years, the cumulative incidence of prostate cancer was 8.2% in the screening group and 4.8% in the control group. The rate ratio for death from prostate cancer in the screening group, as compared with the control group, was 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.98; adjusted P=0.04). The absolute risk difference was 0.71 death per 1000 men. This means that 1410 men would need to be screened and 48 additional cases of prostate cancer would need to be treated to prevent one death from prostate cancer. The analysis of men who were actually screened during the first round (excluding subjects with noncompliance) provided a rate ratio for death from prostate cancer of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.56 to 0.90). CONCLUSIONS: PSA-based screening reduced the rate of death from prostate cancer by 20% but was associated with a high risk of overdiagnosis. (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN49127736.)},

This is why pixel-space video prediction may be viewed as a promising avenue for unsupervised feature learning. In addition, while optical flow has been a very studied problem in computer vision for a long time, future frame prediction is rarely approached. Still, many vision applications could benefit from the knowledge of the next frames of videos, that does not require the complexity of tracking every pixel trajectories. In this work, we train a convolutional network to generate future frames given an input sequence. To deal with the inherently blurry predictions obtained from the standard Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function, we propose three different and complementary feature learning strategies: a multi-scale architecture, an adversarial training method, and an image gradient difference loss function. We compare our predictions to different published results based on recurrent neural networks on the UCF101 dataset},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) detection using serum-based prostate specific antigen (PSA) is limited by frequent false-positive and -negative results. Genetic aberrations such as allelic imbalance (AI) and epigenetic changes such as promoter hypermethylation have been detected in circulating DNA of cancer patients. We hypothesized that circulating multimarker DNA assays detecting both genetic and epigenetic markers in serum would be useful in assessing PCa patients. METHODS: We assayed blood from healthy male donors (n = 40) and 83 patients with American Joint Cancer Committee (AJCC) stage I-IV PCa. DNA was assayed for AI of 6 genome microsatellites. We assessed methylation of RASSF1, RARB2, and GSTP1 using a methylation-specific PCR assay and analyzed the sensitivity of each assay for the detection of genetic or epigenetic changes in circulating DNA. The relation between circulating tumor-related DNA detection and prognostic factors was investigated. RESULTS: The proportion of patients demonstrating AI for > or =1 marker was 47% (38 of 81 patients). Methylation biomarkers were detected in 24 of 83 patients (28%). By combining 2 DNA assays, the number of PCa patients positive for > or =1 methylated or LOH marker increased (52 of 83; 63%). The combined assays detected PCa in 15 of 24 patients (63%) with normal PSA concentrations. The combination of the DNA assays detected the presence of PCa regardless of AJCC stage or PSA concentration. Combination of the DNA and PSA assays gave 89% sensitivity.

abstract = {Background: Active surveillance (AS) aims to allow men with favourable-risk, localised prostate cancer to avoid unnecessary treatment. Objective: To describe the clinical outcomes of a prospective study of AS. Design, setting, and participants: A single-centre, prospective cohort study. Eligibility criteria included histologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma, age 50-80 yr, stage T1/T2, prostate-specific antigen level (PSA) <15 ng/ml, Gleason score (GS) ≤3 + 3 (GS ≤3 + 4 if aged >65 yr), and percent positive biopsy cores (PPC) ≤50%. Intervention: Patients were assessed by serum PSA level, and digital rectal examination at 3-mo intervals in year 1, 4-mo intervals in year 2, and at 6-mo intervals thereafter. Transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy was performed after 18-24 mo and every 2 yr thereafter. Treatment was recommended for PSA velocity (PSAV) >1 ng/ml per year or adverse histology, defined as GS ≥4 + 3 or PPC >50%. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Outcomes described, using Kaplan-Meier methods, were rate of adverse histology on repeat biopsy, freedom from treatment, biochemical control after deferred treatment, and overall survival. Analyses using Cox regression were performed to determine predictors of deferred treatment and adverse histology. Results and limitations: The study enrolled 471 eligible patients from 2002 to 2011. Median age was 66 yr and median initial PSA value was 6.4 ng/ml. Eighty-eight percent of patients had T1 disease and 93% had GS ≤3 + 3. At median follow-up of 5.7 yr, the 5-yr rate of adverse histology and treatment-free probability was 22% (95% confidence interval [CI], 16-29%) and 70% (95% CI, 65-75%), respectively. There were two deaths from prostate cancer. Predictors of time to adverse histology were GS 7, PSAV >1 ng/ml per year, low ratio of free PSA to total PSA, and PPC >25%. Longer follow-up is needed to confirm the safety of this strategy. Conclusions: This study demonstrates satisfactory medium-term outcomes for AS in selected men with localised prostate cancer. {\textcopyright} 2013 European Association of Urology.},

abstract = {Prostate cancer is among the most common cancer in males and its heterogeneity is well known. Its early detection helps making therapeutic decision. There is no standard technique or procedure yet which is full-proof in predicting cancer class. The genomic level changes can be detected in gene expression data and those changes may serve as standard model for any random cancer data for class prediction. Various techniques were implied on prostate cancer data set in order to accurately predict cancer class including machine learning techniques. Huge number of attributes and few number of sample in microarray data leads to poor machine learning, therefore the most challenging part is attribute reduction or non significant gene reduction. In this work we have compared several machine learning techniques for their accuracy in predicting the cancer class i.e., Tumor or Normal. Machine learning is effectively good when the number of attributes (genes) are larger than the number of samples which is rarely possible with gene expression data. Attribute reduction or gene filtering is absolutely required in order to make the data more meaningful as most of the genes do not participate in tumor development and are irrelevant for cancer prediction. Here we have applied combination of statistical techniques such as inter-quartile range and t-test, which has been effective in filtering significant genes and minimizing noise from data. Further we have done a comprehensive evaluation of ten state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for their accuracy in class prediction of prostate cancer. The prostate cancer training data set consists of 12600 genes and 102 samples (instances) and test data set has the same number of genes and 34 different samples and has an overall ten-fold difference from the training data set. After applying inter-quartile range followed by a t-test statistics for attribute reduction we got 856 most significant genes. All the used machine learning techniques were trained with these significant genes. Out of these techniques, Bayes Network out performed with an accuracy of 94.11% followed by Navie Bayes with an accuracy of 91.17%. To cross validate our results, we modified our training dataset in six different way and found that average sensitivity, specificity, precision and accuracy of Bayes Network is highest among all other machine learning techniques used. We also compared our results with the others work on the same kind of dataset and found that our results are better than others.},

abstract = {The Gleason system for prostate cancer was based on a study of 270 patients from the Minneapolis Veterans Administration Hospital in 1966-1967. In 1974, Gleason and the Veterans Administrative Cooperative Urological Research Group expanded this study to 1032 men. These studies formed the basis of the Gleason grading system, which is now endorsed as the primary grading system for prostate cancer by the World Health Organization, the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology Fascicle on prostate cancer, the Association of Directors of Anatomic and Surgical Pathology, and the College of American Pathologists. In the nearly 40 years since its inception, several aspects about prostate cancer and its management have changed, most notably serum prostate-specific antigen, transrectal ultrasonography, 18-gauge needle biopsy sampling, immunohistochemistry for the diagnosis of cancer, and radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy as primary treatment modalities. Several aspects of the disease, and consequently the reporting needs, have changed such as reporting cancer on multiple cases in needle biopsies, multiple nodules in prostatectomy, tertiary patterns, variants and variations in prostate cancer. The application of the Gleason system, therefore, has varied considerably in contemporary surgical pathology practice. An International Consensus Conference attended by 80 urologic pathologists from 20 countries was convened to discuss clarifications and modifications to the Gleason system. This article serves as a brief overview and summary of the proceedings that have been published in detail in recent literature.},

abstract = {PSA levels have shown daily and seasonal variation, although data are conflicting regarding the season with higher PSA levels and the clinical relevance of this. We assessed the correlation of total PSA levels with meteorological data on a daily, weekly, monthly and seasonal basis. Data from 53,224 men aged 45-74 years, with an initial PSA <10.0 ng ml(-1) were correlated with temperature (°C), duration of bright sunshine (hours) and rainfall (mm). There was seasonal variation in PSA levels, with median PSA being higher in spring compared with other seasons (1.18 vs 1.10 ng ml(-1), P = 0.004). Seasonal variation was not apparent when PSA levels were age-adjusted (P = 0.112). Total PSA was not correlated with daily, weekly or monthly hours of sunshine, rainfall or mean temperature. In contrast, age-adjusted PSA varied with weekday, with higher PSA levels on Thursday and Friday compared with other days (1.16 vs 1.10 ng ml(-1), respectively). On multivariate analysis, only age predicted for PSA levels >3.0 ng ml(-1). In conclusion, PSA levels did show seasonal variation, although there was no direct correlation between PSA and any meteorological parameter. The degree of seasonal variation is small and the decision to proceed to prostate biopsy should be independent of season or weather parameters.},

abstract = {Prostatic cancer is diagnosed too late in most cases, so that therapy is frequently ineffective or even not undertaken at all because of the already advanced stage of the disease. An early diagnosis technique for prostatic cancer would therefore be highly desirable, also because all other available markers give very unsatisfactory results. Because of our experience in tissue culture of human prostatic specimens, by which we have shown good correlations with patient prognosis, we attempted to grow epithelial cells collected from prostatic fluid after rectal prostatic massage. Samples from prostatic cancer patients, diagnosed by needle biopsy, were grown in culture and were able to survive in vitro for at least 2 weeks, thus providing morphological and biochemical data concerning their neoplastic and differentiation features. The early data on this new approach, which we believe might represent a very useful test for the early diagnosis of the neoplasm, are reported here. The method is noninvasive and suitable for mass screening of the disease. Accuracy and reliability of the technique are currently being tested.},

Objective To evaluate the utility of a four kallikrein (4K) panel in predicting the presence of high-grade cancer in men on active surveillance. Design, setting, and participants Plasma collected before the first and subsequent surveillance biopsies was assessed for 718 men prospectively enrolled in the multi-institutional Canary PASS trial. Biopsy data were split 2:1 into training and test sets. We developed statistical models that included clinical information and either the 4Kpanel or serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Outcome measurements and statistical analysis The endpoint was reclassification to Gleason ≥7. We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses and area under the curve (AUC) to assess discriminatory capacity, and decision curve analysis (DCA) to report clinical net benefit. Results and limitations Significant predictors for reclassification were 4Kpanel (odds ratio [OR] 1.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31–1.81) or PSA (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.53–2.91), ≥20% cores positive (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.33–3.32), two or more prior negative biopsies (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04–0.85), prostate volume (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.31–0.70), and body mass index (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.04–1.14). ROC curve analysis comparing 4K and base models indicated that the 4Kpanel improved accuracy for predicting reclassification (AUC 0.78 vs 0.74) at the first surveillance biopsy. Both models performed comparably for prediction of reclassification at subsequent biopsies (AUC 0.75 vs 0.76). In DCA, both models showed higher net benefit compared to biopsy-all and biopsy-none strategies. Limitations include the single cohort nature of the study and the small numbers; results should be validated in another cohort before clinical use. Conclusions The 4Kpanel provided incremental value over routine clinical information in predicting high-grade cancer in the first biopsy after diagnosis. The 4Kpanel did not add predictive value to the base model at subsequent surveillance biopsies. Patient summary Active surveillance is a management strategy for many low-grade prostate cancers. Repeat biopsies monitor for previously undetected high-grade cancer. We show that a model with clinical variables, including a panel of four kallikreins, indicates the presence of high-grade cancer before a biopsy is performed.},

abstract = {The development of microarray technology has made it possible to assemble biomedical datasets that measure the expression profile of thousands of genes simultaneously. However, such high-dimensional datasets make computation costly and can complicate the interpretation of a predictive model. To address this, feature selection methods are used to extract biological information from a large amount of data in order to filter the expression dataset down to the smallest possible subset of accurate predictor genes. Feature selection has three main advantages: it decreases computational costs, mitigates the possibility of overfitting due to high inter-variable correlations, and allows for an easier clinical interpretation of the model. In this paper we compare three methods of feature selection : iterative Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), Random Survival Forest (RSF) and Cox Proportional Hazard (CPH) and four methods of survival analysis: Analysis Random Survival Forest (RSF), Cox Proportional Hazard (CPH), Alan Additive Filter (AAF) and Deepsurv (neural network). Feature selection methods permit to extract the most relevant features for survival analysis from the dataset automatically and are compared with a hand selected set of features. Certain survival analysis methods also permit to perform feature selection such as RSF and CPH. All the data we used came from the Metabric breast cancer dataset. For every feature selection method, we compare varied numbers of selected features. Our results indicate that feature selection improves the performance of survival analysis methods. Overall, the best survival analysis performance was obtained by combining RSF for feature selection and Deepsurv for survival prediction.},

abstract = {PURPOSE Gleason grading is an important predictor of prostate cancer (PCa) outcomes. Studies using surrogate PCa end points suggest outcomes for Gleason score (GS) 7 cancers vary according to the predominance of pattern 4. These studies have influenced clinical practice, but it is unclear if rates of PCa mortality differ for 3 + 4 and 4 + 3 tumors. Using PCa mortality as the primary end point, we compared outcomes in Gleason 3 + 4 and 4 + 3 cancers, and the predictive ability of GS from a standardized review versus original scoring. PATIENTS AND METHODS Three study pathologists conducted a blinded standardized review of 693 prostatectomy and 119 biopsy specimens to assign primary and secondary Gleason patterns. Tumor specimens were from PCa patients diagnosed between 1984 and 2004 from the Physicians' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. Lethal PCa (n = 53) was defined as development of bony metastases or PCa death. Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated according to original GS and standardized GS. We compared the discrimination of standardized and original grading with C-statistics from models of 10-year survival. Results For prostatectomy specimens, 4 + 3 cancers were associated with a three-fold increase in lethal PCa compared with 3 + 4 cancers (95% CI, 1.1 to 8.6). The discrimination of models of standardized scores from prostatectomy (C-statistic, 0.86) and biopsy (C-statistic, 0.85) were improved compared to models of original scores (prostatectomy C-statistic, 0.82; biopsy C-statistic, 0.72). CONCLUSION Ignoring the predominance of Gleason pattern 4 in GS 7 cancers may conceal important prognostic information. A standardized review of GS can improve prediction of PCa survival.},

abstract = {Urinary exosomes or microvesicles are being studied intensively to identify potential new biomarkers for renal disease. We sought to identify whether these microvesicles contain nucleic acids. We isolated microvesicles from human urine in the same density range as that previously described for urinary exosomes and found them to have an RNA integrity profile similar to that of kidney tissue, including 18S and 28S rRNA. This profile was better preserved in urinary microvesicles compared with whole cells isolated from urine, suggesting that microvesicles may protect RNA during urine passage. We were able to detect mRNA in the human urinary microvesicles encoding proteins from all regions of the nephron and the collecting duct. Further, to provide a proof of principle, we found that microvesicles isolated from the urine of the V-ATPase B1 subunit knockout mice lacked mRNA of this subunit while containing a normal amount of the B2 subunit and aquaporin 2. The microvesicles were found to be contaminated with extraneous DNA potentially on their surface; therefore, we developed a rapid and reliable means to isolate nucleic acids from within urine microvesicles devoid of this extraneous contamination. Our study provides an experimental strategy for the routine isolation and use of urinary microvesicles as a novel and non-invasive source of nucleic acids to further renal disease biomarker discovery.},

abstract = {TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusions are the predominant molecular subtype of prostate cancer. Here, we explored the role of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion product using in vitro and in vivo model systems. Transgenic mice expressing the ERG gene fusion product under androgen-regulation develop mouse prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), a precursor lesion of prostate cancer. Introduction of the ERG gene fusion product into primary or immortalized benign prostate epithelial cells induced an invasion-associated transcriptional program but did not increase cellular proliferation or anchorage-independent growth. These results suggest that TMPRSS2-ERG may not be sufficient for transformation in the absence of secondary molecular lesions. Transcriptional profiling of ERG knockdown in the TMPPRSS2-ERG-positive prostate cancer cell line VCaP revealed decreased expression of genes over-expressed in prostate cancer versus PIN and genes overexpressed in ETS-positive versus -negative prostate cancers in addition to inhibiting invasion. ERG knockdown in VCaP cells also induced a transcriptional program consistent with prostate differentiation. Importantly, VCaP cells and benign prostate cells overexpressing ERG directly engage components of the plasminogen activation pathway to mediate cellular invasion, potentially representing a downstream ETS target susceptible to therapeutic intervention. Our results support previous work suggesting that TMPRSS2-ERG fusions mediate invasion, consistent with the defining histologic distinction between PIN and prostate cancer.},

abstract = {Background TMPRSS2:ERG (T2:ERG) and prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) are the most advanced urine-based prostate cancer (PCa) early detection biomarkers. Objective Validate logistic regression models, termed Mi-Prostate Score (MiPS), that incorporate serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA; or the multivariate Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial risk calculator version 1.0 [PCPTrc]) and urine T2:ERG and PCA3 scores for predicting PCa and high-grade PCa on biopsy. Design, setting, and participants T2:ERG and PCA3 scores were generated using clinical-grade transcription-mediated amplification assays. Pretrained MiPS models were applied to a validation cohort of whole urine samples prospectively collected after digital rectal examination from 1244 men presenting for biopsy. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Area under the curve (AUC) was used to compare the performance of serum PSA (or the PCPTrc) alone and MiPS models. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to assess clinical benefit. Results and limitations Among informative validation cohort samples (n = 1225 [98%], 80% from patients presenting for initial biopsy), models incorporating T2:ERG had significantly greater AUC than PSA (or PCPTrc) for predicting PCa (PSA: 0.693 vs 0.585; PCPTrc: 0.718 vs 0.639; both p < 0.001) or high-grade (Gleason score >6) PCa on biopsy (PSA: 0.729 vs 0.651, p < 0.001; PCPTrc: 0.754 vs 0.707, p = 0.006). MiPS models incorporating T2:ERG score had significantly greater AUC (all p < 0.001) than models incorporating only PCA3 plus PSA (or PCPTrc or high-grade cancer PCPTrc [PCPThg]). DCA demonstrated net benefit of the MiPS_PCPTrc (or MiPS_PCPThg) model compared with the PCPTrc (or PCPThg) across relevant threshold probabilities. Conclusions Incorporating urine T2:ERG and PCA3 scores improves the performance of serum PSA (or PCPTrc) for predicting PCa and high-grade PCa on biopsy. Patient summary Incorporation of two prostate cancer (PCa)-specific biomarkers (TMPRSS2:ERG and PCA3) measured in the urine improved on serum prostate-specific antigen (or a multivariate risk calculator) for predicting the presence of PCa and high-grade PCa on biopsy. A combined test, Mi-Prostate Score, uses models validated in this study and is clinically available to provide individualized risk estimates.},

abstract = {Prediction is ubiquitous across the spectrum of cancer care from screening to hospice. Indeed, oncology is often primarily a prediction problem; many of the early stage cancers cause no symptoms, and treatment is recom-mended because of a prediction that tumor progression would ultimately threaten a patient's quality of life or sur-vival. Recent years have seen attempts to formalize risk prediction in cancer care. In place of qualitative and implicit prediction algorithms, such as cancer stage, researchers have developed statistical prediction tools that provide a quantitative estimate of the probability of a specific event for an individual patient. Prediction models generally have greater accuracy than reliance on stage or risk groupings, can incorporate novel predictors such as genomic data, and can be used more rationally to make treatment decisions. Several prediction models are now widely used in clinical practice, including the Gail model for breast cancer incidence or the Adjuvant! Online prediction model for breast cancer recurrence. Given the burgeoning complexity of diagnostic and prognostic information, there is simply no realistic alternative to incorporating multiple variables into a single prediction model. As such, the question should not be whether but how prediction models should be used to aid decision-making. Key issues will be integra-tion of models into the electronic health record and more careful evaluation of models, particularly with respect to their effects on clinical outcomes.},

Methods Data from 6664 Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial placebo arm biopsies (5826 individuals), where prostate-specific antigen and digital rectal examination results were available within 1 year before the biopsy and PSA was ≤10 ng/mL, were used to develop a nominal logistic regression model to predict the risk of no vs low-grade (Gleason grade ;lt&7) vs high-grade cancer (Gleason grade ≥7). Percent free-PSA was incorporated into the model based on likelihood ratio analysis of a San Antonio Biomarkers of Risk cohort. Models were externally validated on 10 Prostate Biopsy Collaborative Group cohorts and 1 Early Detection Research Network reference set. Results Of all the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial biopsies, 5468 (82.1%) were negative for prostate cancer, 942 (14.1%) detected low-grade, and 254 (3.8%) detected high-grade disease. Significant predictors were (log base 2) PSA (odds ratio for low-grade vs no cancer, 1.29*; high-grade vs no cancer, 2.02*; high-grade vs low-grade cancer, 1.57*), digital rectal examination (0.96, 1.49*, 1.55*, respectively), age (1.02*, 1.05*, 1.03*, respectively), African American race (1.13, 2.83*, 2.51*, respectively), prior biopsy (0.63*, 0.81, 1.27, respectively), and family history (1.31*, 1.25, 0.95, respectively), where* indicates P value ≤.05. The new PCPTRC 2.0 either with or without percent free-PSA (also significant by the likelihood ratio method) validated well externally.

abstract = {Background: Prostate cancer is a major public health problem with considerable uncertainties about the effectiveness of population screening and treatment options. We report the study design, participant sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and the initial results of the testing and diagnostic phase of the Prostate testing for cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) trial, which aims to investigate the effectiveness of treatments for localised prostate cancer. Methods: In this randomised phase 3 trial, men aged 50-69 years registered at 337 primary care centres in nine UK cities were invited to attend a specialist nurse appointment for a serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test. Prostate biopsies were offered to men with a PSA concentration of 3{\textperiodcentered}0 $\mu$g/L or higher. Consenting participants with clinically localised prostate cancer were randomly assigned to active monitoring (surveillance strategy), radical prostatectomy, or three-dimensional conformal external-beam radiotherapy by a computer-generated allocation system. Randomisation was stratified by site (minimised for differences in participant age, PSA results, and Gleason score). The primary endpoint is prostate cancer mortality at a median 10-year follow-up, ascertained by an independent committee, which will be analysed by intention to treat in 2016. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02044172, and as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN20141297. Findings: Between Oct 1, 2001, and Jan 20, 2009, 228 966 men were invited to attend an appointment with a specialist nurse. Of the invited men, 100 444 (44%) attended their initial appointment and 82 429 (82%) of attenders had a PSA test. PSA concentration was below the biopsy threshold in 73 538 (89%) men. Of the 8566 men with a PSA concentration of 3{\textperiodcentered}0-19{\textperiodcentered}9 $\mu$g/L, 7414 (87%) underwent biopsies. 2896 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer (4% of tested men and 39% of those who had a biopsy), of whom 2417 (83%) had clinically localised disease (mostly T1c, Gleason score 6). With the addition of 247 pilot study participants recruited between 1999 and 2001, 2664 men were eligible for the treatment trial and 1643 (62%) agreed to be randomly assigned (545 to active monitoring, 545 to radiotherapy, and 553 to radical prostatectomy). Clinical and sociodemographic characteristics of randomly assigned participants were balanced across treatment groups. Interpretation: The ProtecT trial randomly assigned 1643 men with localised prostate cancer to active monitoring, radiotherapy, or surgery. Participant clinicopathological features are more consistent with contemporary patient characteristics than in previous prostate cancer treatment trials.

@article{Vickers2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) Risk Calculator is a widely used prediction tool for aiding decisions about biopsy for prostate cancer. This study hypothesized that recently reported differences between predictions from the model and findings from other cohorts were due to how prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was entered into the statistical model, and to the inclusion of protocol end-of-study biopsies for which there was no clinical indication.\n\nMETHODS: Data was obtained from the 5088 PCPT participants and was used to construct the PCPT Risk Calculator. The relationship between PSA and the risk of a positive biopsy was modeled by using locally-weighted regression (lowess), an empirical estimate of actual risks observed which does not depend on a statistical model. Risks were estimated with and without the 3514 end-of-study biopsies.\n\nRESULTS: For PSA levels above biopsy thresholds (∼4 ng/mL), the PCPT Risk Calculator greatly overestimated actual empirical risks (eg, 44% versus 26% at 5 ng/mL). The change in risk with increasing PSA was less among for-cause biopsies compared with the end-of-study biopsies (P = .001). Risk of high-grade disease was overestimated at PSA level of ≥ 6 ng/mL.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The PCPT Risk Calculator overestimates risks for PSAs close to and above typical biopsy thresholds. Separating for-cause biopsies from end-of-study biopsies and using empirical rather than model-based risks reduces overall risk estimates and replicates prior findings that, in men who have been screened with PSA, there is no rapid increase in prostate cancer risk with higher PSA. Revision of the PCPT Risk Calculator should be considered.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The outcome of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is still unpredictable. Even with new targeted therapies, the average progression-free survival is dismal. Markers for early detection and progression could improve disease outcome.\n\nMETHODS: To identify efficient and hitherto unrecognized pathogenic factors of the disease, we performed a uniquely comprehensive pathway analysis and built a gene interaction network based on large publicly available data sets assembled from 28 publications, comprising a 3-prong approach with high-throughput mRNA, microRNA, and protein expression profiles of 593 ccRCC and 389 normal kidney samples. We validated our results on 2 different data sets of 882 ccRCC and 152 normal tissues. Functional analyses were done by proliferation, migration, and invasion assays following siRNA (small interfering RNA) knockdown.\n\nRESULTS: After integration of multilevel data, we identified aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), grainyhead-like-2 (GRHL2), and KIAA0101 as new pathogenic factors. GRHL2 expression was associated with higher chances for disease relapse and retained prognostic utility after controlling for grade and stage [hazard ratio (HR), 3.47, P = 0.012]. Patients with KIAA0101-positive expression suffered worse disease-free survival (HR, 3.64, P < 0.001), and in multivariate analysis KIAA0101 retained its independent prognostic significance. Survival analysis showed that GRHL2- and KIAA0101-positive patients had significantly lower disease-free survival (P = 0.002 and P < 0.001). We also found that KIAA0101 silencing decreased kidney cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Using an integrative system biology approach, we identified 3 novel factors as potential biomarkers (AHR, GRHL2 and KIAA0101) involved in ccRCC pathogenesis and not linked to kidney cancer before.},

abstract = {This study was designed to determine the effects of age by decade on the efficacy of digital rectal examination (DRE) and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for early detection of prostate cancer in men aged fifty and over. A prospective multicenter clinical trial was conducted at six university centers. All 6,630 male volunteers underwent a serum PSA (Hybritech, Tandem) determination and DRE. Quadrant biopsies of the prostate were performed if PSA was > 4 ng/mL or DRE suspicious. A total of 1,167 biopsies were performed, and 264 cancers were detected. The cancer detection rate increased from 3 percent in men aged fifty to fifty-nine to 14 percent in men eighty years or older (p < 0.0001). PSA detected significantly more of the total cancers than DRE at all age ranges (p < 0.05). The positive predictive values (PPV) for PSA were 32 percent (50-59 years), 30 percent (60-69 years), 34 percent (70-79 years), and 38 percent (80+ years). The corresponding PPVs for DRE were 17 percent, 21 percent, 25 percent, and 38 percent. Eighteen percent of the cancers were detected solely by DRE, whereas 45 percent of cancers were detected solely by PSA. Thus, the use of both tests in combination provided the highest rate of detection in all age groups. One hundred-sixty patients underwent radical prostatectomy and pathologic staging. Cancer was organ-confined in 74 percent (25/34) of men aged fifty to fifty-nine, 76 percent (65/86) of men aged sixty to sixty-nine, and 60 percent (24/40) of men aged seventy or over (chi 2, < 70 vs. > or = 70, p < 0.05). Early detection programs yield a lower, yet still substantial, cancer detection rate in younger men, and there is a greater likelihood for detection of organ-confined disease in this age range. Younger men have the longest projected life expectancy and, therefore, the most to gain from early prostate cancer detection.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Docetaxel-resistance limits successful treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer. We previously demonstrated that extracellular vesicles (exosomes) may play a role in regulating docetaxel resistance. Here, we investigated intracellular and extracellular (exosomal) miRNAs related to docetaxel resistance.\n\nMETHODS: Following global miRNA profiling of cell line models of docetaxel-resistance and their corresponding exosomes, we investigated the clinical relevance of four selected miRNAs (miR-598, miR-34a, miR-146a, miR-148a) in four publically available clinical cohorts representing both primary and advanced disease in tissue and urine specimens. One of these miRNAs, miR-34a was selected for functional evaluation by miRNA inhibition and over-expression in vitro. We further assessed the panel of miRNAs for their combined clinical relevance as a biomarker signature by examining their common predicted targets.\n\nRESULTS: A strong correlation was found between the detection of miRNAs in exosomes and their corresponding cells of origin. Of the miRNAs chosen for further validation and clinical assessment, decreased miR-34a levels showed substantial clinical relevance and so was chosen for further analysis. Manipulating miR-34a in prostate cancer cells confirms that this miRNA regulates BCL-2 and may, in part, regulate response to docetaxel. When combined, these miRNAs are predicted to regulate a range of common mRNA targets, two of which (e.g., SNCA, SCL7A5) demonstrate a strong relationship with prostate cancer progression and poor prognosis.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study supports the extracellular environment as an important source of minimally invasive predictive biomarkers representing their cellular origin. Using miR-34a as example, we showed that biomarkers identified in this manner may also hold functional relevance. Prostate {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.

abstract = {Purpose: FGFR3 mutations occur in 70% of nonmuscle invasive bladder tumors. Although urine based FGFR3 mutation analysis can detect recurrence, its sensitivity may be limited if samples have few or no tumor cells. We determined whether test sensitivity depends on tumor size and the time point of urine collection, and how to increase sensitivity. Materials and Methods: A total of 440 urine samples from 18 patients with a suspicious bladder lesion at cystoscopy were collected during 6 days before surgery. Eight patients (300 samples) had an FGFR3 mutant tumor, including 4 each with a tumor greater than 3 and less than 1.5 cm. Polymerase chain reaction based FGFR3 analysis was done on all tumors and urine samples. Results: FGFR3 mutations were detected in 257 of the 300 urine samples (86%) from patients with an FGFR3 mutant tumor. Assay sensitivity was 100% for tumors greater than 3 cm and 75% for tumors less than 1.5 cm. It increased to 100% in patients with a less than 1.5 cm tumor when samples were pooled during 24 hours. Sensitivity was not influenced by the time of urine collection. All urine samples from patients with an FGFR3 wild-type tumor were negative for FGFR3 mutation. Conclusions: The sensitivity of tumor detection increased with tumor size. FGFR3 assay sensitivity depends on the number of shed tumor cells and improves by increasing urine volume.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of surgery versus observation for men with localized prostate cancer detected by means of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing is not known.\n\nMETHODS: From November 1994 through January 2002, we randomly assigned 731 men with localized prostate cancer (mean age, 67 years; median PSA value, 7.8 ng per milliliter) to radical prostatectomy or observation and followed them through January 2010. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality; the secondary outcome was prostate-cancer mortality.\n\nRESULTS: During the median follow-up of 10.0 years, 171 of 364 men (47.0%) assigned to radical prostatectomy died, as compared with 183 of 367 (49.9%) assigned to observation (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71 to 1.08; P=0.22; absolute risk reduction, 2.9 percentage points). Among men assigned to radical prostatectomy, 21 (5.8%) died from prostate cancer or treatment, as compared with 31 men (8.4%) assigned to observation (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.36 to 1.09; P=0.09; absolute risk reduction, 2.6 percentage points). The effect of treatment on all-cause and prostate-cancer mortality did not differ according to age, race, coexisting conditions, self-reported performance status, or histologic features of the tumor. Radical prostatectomy was associated with reduced all-cause mortality among men with a PSA value greater than 10 ng per milliliter (P=0.04 for interaction) and possibly among those with intermediate-risk or high-risk tumors (P=0.07 for interaction). Adverse events within 30 days after surgery occurred in 21.4% of men, including one death.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Among men with localized prostate cancer detected during the early era of PSA testing, radical prostatectomy did not significantly reduce all-cause or prostate-cancer mortality, as compared with observation, through at least 12 years of follow-up. Absolute differences were less than 3 percentage points. (Funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program and others; PIVOT ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00007644.).},

abstract = {Vesicles are released during the in vitro culture of sheep reticulocytes which can be harvested by centrifugation at 100,000 X g for 90 min. These vesicles contain a number of activities, characteristic of the reticulocyte plasma membrane, which are known to diminish or disappear upon reticulocyte maturation. The activities include acetylcholinesterase, cytochalasin B binding (glucose transporter) nucleoside binding (i.e. nucleoside transporter), Na+-independent amino acid transport, and the transferrin receptor. Enzymes of cytosolic origin are not detectable or are present at low activity in the vesicles. Cultures of whole blood, mature red cells, or white cells do not yield comparable levels of these activities, supporting the conclusion that the activities arise from the reticulocytes. In addition, the lipid composition of the vesicles shows the high sphingomyelin content characteristic of sheep red cell plasma membranes, but not white cell or platelet membranes, also consistent with the conclusion that the vesicles are of reticulocyte origin. It is suggested that vesicle externalization may be a mechanism for shedding of specific membrane functions which are known to diminish during maturation of reticulocytes to erythrocytes.},

abstract = {Context: Although progress has been made with regard to types of markers (protein, DNA, RNA, and metabolites) and implementation of improved technologies (mass spectrometry, arrays, and deep sequencing), the discovery of novel biomarkers for prostate cancer (PCa) in complex fluids, such as serum and urine, remains a challenge. Meanwhile, recent studies have reported that many cancer-derived proteins and RNAs are secreted through small vesicles known as exosomes. Objective: This narrative review describes recent progress in exosome research, focusing on the potential role of exosomes as novel biomarkers for PCa. The purpose of this review is to acquaint clinicians and researchers in the field of urology with the potential role of exosomes as biomarker treasure chests and with their clinical value. Evidence acquisition: Medline and Embase entries between 1966 and September 2010 were searched using the keywords exosomes, microvesicles, prostasomes, biomarkers, prostate cancer, and urology. Leading publications and articles constructively contributing to exosome research were selected for this review. Evidence synthesis: Exosomes are small vesicles (50-100 nm) secreted by almost all tissues; they represent their tissue origin. Purification of prostate- and PCa-derived exosomes will allow us to profile exosomes, providing a promising source of protein and RNA biomarkers for PCa. This profiling will contribute to the discovery of novel markers for the early diagnosis and reliable prognosis of PCa. Conclusions: Although the initial results are promising, further investigations are required to assess the clinical value of these exosomes in PCa. ?? 2010 European Association of Urology.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel Along with significant advances in prostate cancer biology research, we also observe the rapid development of modern diagnostic tests. New biomarkers are derived to detect disease while it is organ-confined to stratify the risk and to aid clinical decision-making. Majority of these tools have already been validated clinically, but only a few have received premarket clearance and administration approval. Superiority of novel tests is visible not only in improved detection accuracy but predominantly in the assessment of tumour aggressiveness and selection of patients eligible for conservative management. Two factors limiting the clinical implementation of validated biomarker candidates are costs and local availability. For these reasons, currently, their true clinical role starts after routine screening with prostate-specific antigen test. With this review of prostate cancer biomarkers, we attempted to draw general conclusions on clinical perspectives of these novel tools.},

abstract = {Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are major pathogens associated with the development of cancer of the uterine cervix, the most common malignant tumour of women worldwide. Reliable diagnosis of HPV infection, particularly the 'high-risk' types (16/18), may facilitate early identification of 'high-risk' populations for developing cervical cancer and may augment the sensitivity and specificity of primary cervical cancer screening programmes by complementing the conventional Pap test. A simple paper smear method has been developed for dry collection, transport and storage of cervical smears/scrapes at room temperature for subsequent detection of HPV DNA by PCR assay. Imprint biopsies, blood and fine-needle aspirates were also collected by this method. The cervical scrapes or other body fluids were smeared (within 0.5-1 cm diameter) and dried on to sterile small slides made of Whatman 3MM filter paper, and stored individually at room temperature or at 4 degrees C. A small piece (2-3 mm) of the paper smear was punched or cut out with a sterile surgical blade, boiled in an eppendorf tube containing 50 microl of distilled water for 5 min and used directly for PCR amplification. The quality and quantity of DNA derived from paper smears and the results of PCR amplifications for HPV type 16, BRCA1 and p53 genes were identical to those obtained from the same samples following collection in PBS, storage (-70 degrees C) and phenol-chloroform-based DNA extraction. DNA was stable in the paper smears for up to a year, whether stored at room temperature or at 4 degrees C. This method is simple, rapid and cost-effective, and can be effectively employed for large-scale population screening, especially for regions where the specimens are to be transported from distant places to the laboratory.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Although there is uncertainty about the effect of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening on the rate of prostate cancer death, there is little uncertainty about its effect on the rate of prostate cancer diagnosis. Systematic estimates of the number of men affected, however, to our knowledge, do not exist. METHODS We obtained data on age-specific incidence and initial course of therapy from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. We then used age-specific male population estimates from the US Census to determine the excess (or deficit) in the number of men diagnosed and treated in each year after 1986-the year before PSA screening was introduced. RESULTS Overall incidence of prostate cancer rose rapidly after 1986, peaked in 1992, and then declined, albeit to levels considerably higher than those in 1986. Overall incidence, however, obscured distinct age-specific patterns: The relative incidence rate (2005 relative to 1986) was 0.56 in men aged 80 years and older, 1.09 in men aged 70-79 years, 1.91 in men aged 60-69 years, 3.64 in men aged 50-59 years, and 7.23 in men younger than 50 years. Since 1986, an estimated additional 1 305 600 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer, 1 004 800 of whom were definitively treated for the disease. Using the most optimistic assumption about the benefit of screening-that the entire decline in prostate cancer mortality observed during this period is attributable to this additional diagnosis-we estimated that, for each man who experienced the presumed benefit, more than 20 had to be diagnosed with prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS The introduction of PSA screening has resulted in more than 1 million additional men being diagnosed and treated for prostate cancer in the United States. The growth is particularly dramatic for younger men. Given the considerable time that has passed since PSA screening began, most of this excess incidence must represent overdiagnosis.},

abstract = {The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of indolent prostate cancer (PCa) is a serious health issue in most developed countries. There is an unmet clinical need for noninvasive, easy to administer, diagnostic assays to help assess whether a prostate biopsy is warranted. OBJECTIVE To determine the performance of a novel urine exosome gene expression assay (the ExoDx Prostate IntelliScore urine exosome assay) plus standard of care (SOC) (ie, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level, age, race, and family history) vs SOC alone for discriminating between Gleason score (GS)7 and GS6 and benign disease on initial biopsy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In training, using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we compared the urine exosome gene expression assay with biopsy outcomes in 499 patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of 2 to20 ng/mL. The derived prognostic score was then validated in 1064 patients from 22 community practice and academic urology clinic sites in the United States. Eligible participants included PCa-free men, 50 years or older, scheduled for an initial or repeated prostate needle biopsy due to suspicious digital rectal examination (DRE) findings and/or PSA levels (limit range, 2.0-20.0 ng/mL)},

abstract = {Exosomes, membrane vesicles of 40-100 nm in diameter, are derived from endosomes in various cells. The bioactive molecules specifically packed into exosomes can be horizontally transferred into recipient cells changing their biological properties, by which tumour cells continuously modify their surrounding microenvironment and distant target cells favouring cancer metastasis. It has been suspected for a long time that exosomes participate in the whole process of tumour metastasis. Although there is much unknown and many controversies in the role of cancer exosome, the major contribution of tumour-associated exosomes to different steps of cancer metastasis are demonstrated in this review. Mainly because these exosomes are easily accessible and capable of representing their parental cells, exosomes draw much attention as a promising biomarker for tumour screening, diagnosis and prognosis. Currently, researchers have found numerous biomarkers in exosomes with great potential to be utilized in personalized medicine. In this article, we summarize the roles of biomarkers, which are validated by clinical samples. Even though many conundrums remain, such as exosome extraction, large multicentre validation of biomarkers and data interpretation, exosomes are certain to be used in clinical practice in the near future as the field rapidly expands.},

abstract = {At present, only three risk factors for prostate cancer have been firmly established; these are all nonmodifiable: age, race, and a positive family history of prostate cancer. However, numerous modifiable factors have also been implicated in the development of prostate cancer. In the current review, we summarize the epidemiologic data for age, location, and selected behavioral factors in relation to the onset of prostate cancer. Although the available data are not entirely consistent, possible preventative behavioral factors include increased physical activity, intakes of tomatoes, cruciferous vegetables, and soy. Factors that may enhance prostate cancer risk include frequent consumption of dairy products and, possibly, meat. By comparison, alcohol probably exerts no important influence on prostate cancer development. Similarly, dietary supplements are unlikely to protect against the onset of prostate cancer in healthy men. Several factors, such as smoking and obesity, show a weak association with prostate cancer incidence but a positive relation with prostate cancer mortality. Other factors, such as fish intake, also appear to be unassociated with incident prostate cancer but show an inverse relation with fatal prostate cancer. Such heterogeneity in the relationship between behavioral factors and nonadvanced, advanced, or fatal prostate cancers helps shed light on the carcinogenetic process because it discerns the impact of exposure on early and late stages of prostate cancer development. Inconsistent associations between behavioral factors and prostate cancer risk seen in previous studies may in part be due to uncontrolled detection bias because of current widespread use of prostate-specific antigen testing for prostate cancer, and the possibility that certain behavioral factors are systematically related to the likelihood of undergoing screening examinations. In addition, several genes may modify the study results, but data concerning specific gene-environment interactions are currently sparse. Despite large improvements in our understanding of prostate cancer risk factors in the past two decades, present knowledge does not allow definitive recommendations for specific preventative behavioral interventions.},
